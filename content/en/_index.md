        Around 1998 I stumbled upon the Internet while studying computer engineering, and by 2000 it had already pulled me into the industry. I've been a designer, developer, UX specialist, SEO, entrepreneur, executive, mentor, consultant… In short, I've probably taken part in 99% of what makes an online business work — always with passion, enthusiasm, and TEAM spirit.

        Throughout my career I've been lucky to surround myself with people smarter than me. Thanks to endless curiosity and a constant hunger to learn, I've always been driven by what's new, unexplored, optimizable and measurable — especially user experience and content positioning with conversion in mind.

        I've worked at Solostocks (Grupo Intercom), Softonic, Uvinum (which I proudly created and co-founded), Drinks&Co Marketplace, and I've collaborated with many startups. More recently I was involved in CryptoAdvisor.club and dove deep into the crypto world (cryptocurrencies, crypto assets, NFTs, Web3, metaverse, DeFi, etc.).

        Today my professional journey keeps evolving. Since 2022 I've combined my experience with the rise of AI, joining Mindset Digital as partner and SEO Manager — a boutique digital growth agency in Barcelona. Together with Hugo Palomar and the team (Iván González, Jordi Gost…), we're expanding the horizons of marketing and digital presence through SEO for LLMs. On top of that, I'm also immersed in several side projects that I'm truly excited about: VinomadaWine (with Juan Manuel Gonzalvo), Logoteo (with Miquel Pascual) and LeGoodAnfitrión, a mobile app we're building with huge enthusiasm.

        Always moving, always exploring new opportunities and challenges to keep growing and learning in this dynamic digital world. If you're looking for innovation, creativity and experience, here I am!
