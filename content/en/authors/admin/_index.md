# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "Back in 1998 I came across the Internet while studying computer engineering, and by 2000 its effect had me working on it. I have been a designer, frontend developer, programmer, usability specialist, SEO, entrepreneur, manager, mentor, consultant... In short, I have surely participated in 99% of everything that an internet business encompasses, and always with passion, enthusiasm and TEAM!

Throughout my career I have been lucky enough to be able to surround myself with people better than me and, thanks to an incessant curiosity and eternal thirst for learning, I have always been moved by the new, the unexplored, optimization and measurement, and especially the user experience and the positioning of content to convert.

So far, I have worked at Solostocks (Grupo Intercom), Softonic, Uvinum (a brand I was the proud creator and co-founder of), Drinks&Co Marketplace, and I have collaborated with maaaany startups. Today I am involved in CryptoAdvisor.club and I am diving into the new crypto world (cryptocurrencies, cryptoassets, NFTs, Web3, metaverse, DeFi, etc).

Find me if you are looking for something."
