## Data Collected and Purpose

**Contact form.** When you submit a message through the contact form, your name, email address and message content are collected. This data is used solely to respond to your enquiry and is not shared with third parties.

**Comments (Disqus).** This site uses Disqus to manage post comments. If you participate in the comments, Disqus collects and processes data according to their own [privacy policy](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy). Albert López Gálvez has no access to or control over that data.

**Web analytics (Google Analytics 4).** Google Analytics 4 is used to obtain anonymous, aggregated usage statistics (pages visited, traffic source, device type). Data is anonymised before being sent to Google and is not used to identify you personally. You can opt out by installing the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Hosting (Netlify).** This site is hosted by Netlify, Inc. Their servers may log standard HTTP request data (IP address, browser, date and time). See [Netlify's privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

## Legal Basis for Processing

- Contact form: explicit consent when submitting the form (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
- Web analytics: legitimate interest in improving the site (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).

## Data Retention

Contact form messages are kept for as long as needed to handle your enquiry and no longer than 2 years. Analytics data is retained according to Google Analytics retention settings (14 months by default).

## Your Rights

Under the GDPR, you have the right to:

- **Access:** know what personal data is being processed about you.
- **Rectification:** correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Erasure:** request deletion of your data.
- **Restriction:** request that processing be restricted.
- **Objection:** object to processing based on legitimate interest.
- **Portability:** receive your data in a structured, portable format.

To exercise these rights, write to albert@albertlg.com. If you believe processing infringes data protection law, you may lodge a complaint with the [Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD)](https://www.aepd.es) or the supervisory authority in your country of residence.
