<p><strong>1.- Continue the sequence:</strong></p>
<p><code>1<br /> 11<br /> 21<br /> 1211<br /> 111221<br /> 312211<br /> ...</code></p>

<p><strong>2.- How many sheep did each one have?</strong><br />
Two shepherds:<br />
- Why don’t you give me one of your sheep? Then we’ll both have the same number.<br />
- Better give me one of yours… that way I’ll have twice as many sheep as you.</p>

<p>I’ll add more puzzles soon. <strong>:)</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.- What color is the bear?</strong><br />
A bear walks 10 km south, 10 km east and 10 km north, returning to the point where it started.</p>

<p><strong>4.- How should he do it?</strong><br />
A shepherd has to take a wolf, a goat and a lettuce across a river.
He has a boat that can only carry him and one of the other three items.
If the wolf is left alone with the goat, it eats it.
If the goat is left alone with the lettuce, it eats it…</p>

<p><strong>5.- How did he figure out which switch turns on the light by walking down the hallway only once?</strong><br />
A man stands at the beginning of a long hallway with three switches.
At the end there is a room with the door closed.
One of the switches turns on the light in that room, which is initially off…<br />
<em>Hint: the man has a flashlight.</em> (hehe)</p>

<p><strong>6.- How can he save himself?</strong><br />
A prisoner is locked in a cell with two doors: one leads to death and the other to freedom.
Each door is guarded by a watchman. The prisoner knows that one always tells the truth
and the other always lies. To choose the door he may only ask one question to one guard…</p>

<p><strong>7.- Where is the missing peseta?</strong><br />
Three friends with financial difficulties share a coffee that costs 30 pesetas,
so each pays 10. When they go to pay, they ask for a discount and the owner gives them
5 pesetas back, giving one peseta to each and keeping two in a common fund.
Later they do the math and say: each of us paid 9 pesetas, so we spent 9x3=27 pesetas,
and with the two in the fund that makes 29…</p>

<p><strong>8.- What does he say so they don’t kill him?</strong><br />
A hiker is captured by cannibals and they tell him:<br />
- If you tell a lie we will kill you slowly, and if you tell the truth we will kill you quickly.</p>

<p><strong>9.- How is this possible?</strong><br />
Three brothers divide their father’s inheritance, consisting of 35 horses.
In his will the father stated that the eldest should get half,
the middle one a third and the youngest a ninth.
Since the divisions were not exact, they consulted an old mathematician, who proposed the following:<br />
- Since 35 horses cannot be divided exactly by half, a third or a ninth,
I will give you mine. Now you have 36 horses.
The eldest gets 18, the middle one 12 and the youngest 4.
That adds up to 34 horses, so two are left:
I take back mine and keep the other one as payment for solving your problem.</p>

<p><strong>10.- Math magic</strong><br />
Write the number 12345679 on a piece of paper (note that the 8 is missing).
Ask a friend to give you a digit from 1 to 9, multiply it mentally by 9,
write the result under the number 12345679 and ask your friend to multiply the two numbers.
They will be amazed by the result.</p>
