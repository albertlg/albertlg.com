<p>Basketball is an art:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img class="fotobonita"
       style="margin: 4px; vertical-align: middle;"
       src="/img/post/basketball.jpg"
       alt="Basketball"
       width="292"
       height="292" />
</p>

<p>The thing is, real artists are not that common...</p>

<p>
  A parable – an anecdote:<br />
  If you were walking down the street and came across an empty soda can on the ground,
  what would you do?<br />
  When I was a kid, they told me that a basketball player would pick it up with their
  hands, <strong>try to dribble it</strong>, and then “sink” it into the first trash can
  they found… instead of kicking it, like most people would.
</p>

<p>By the way, speaking of “messages” and trash cans:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/post/no-bomb.gif"
       border="0"
       alt="No bombs"
       width="100"
       height="102"
       align="middle" />
</p>

<p>
  Because civic behavior and sport always go hand in hand.
  <strong>;)</strong>
