<p>Here is the poster that presides over and/or decorates my desk in my home office...</p>

<p>And some of his famous quotes:</p>

<div class="p-shadow">
  <div>
    <p style="padding-left: 12px; font-size: 1.1em;">
      <strong>
        “Only two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity, and I’m not so sure about the former...”<br /><br />
        “Everyone is a genius… until they open their mouth.”<br /><br />
        “Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.”<br /><br />
        “Sometimes I think the clearest proof that intelligent life exists somewhere in the universe<br />
        is that no one has tried to contact us.”<br /><br />
        “It is easier to split an atom than to break a prejudice.”<br /><br />
        “Longing for the past is like running against the wind.”
      </strong><br /><br />
      Albert Einstein

However, what fascinates me most about this great genius (and perhaps what I try to apply most in my daily life) is his “adapted” Theory of Relativity:
<strong>EVERYTHING IS RELATIVE</strong>. :P
</p>

<p>According to the R.A.E. ...</p>

<div class="sidebox">
  <div class="boxhead">
    <h2>Relativity</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="boxbody">
    <p><strong>1. n.</strong> The quality of being relative.</p>
    <p><strong>2. n. <em>Phys.</em></strong> A theory that seeks to determine how physical laws change when the frame of reference is altered.</p>
    <p><strong>~ special</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. n. <em>Phys.</em></strong> The theory formulated by the German scientist Einstein, based on the fact that light propagates independently of the motion of the body emitting it, and that there is no phenomenon capable of determining whether a body is at rest or in uniform rectilinear motion.</p>

<div class="sidebox">
  <div class="boxhead">
    <h2>Relative</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="boxbody">
    <p>(From Latin <em>relatīvus</em>)</p>
    <p><strong>1. adj.</strong> Related to someone or something.</p>
    <p><strong>2. adj.</strong> Not absolute.</p>
    <p><strong>3. adj.</strong> Limited; not very much. <em>He gave that matter a relative importance</em>.</p>
