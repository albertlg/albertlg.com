  In a post titled “Global Worming”, Urs Hoelze (VP of Operations and
  Google Fellow) explains the incident that surprised us all last
  Monday, July 26th, on Google’s official weblog. And yes, there’s no
  shortage of humour...
</p>
<p>
  The explanation is that someone sent out the latest version of the
  <strong>MyDoom</strong> virus, which carried out a series of automated
  searches on the world-famous search engine, causing it to go down. It
  is therefore ruled out that Google was “hacked”.
</p>
<p>
  The humorous touch comes from the “Error-27” page: Google realised
  that its message for blocked searches was neither friendly nor
  communicatively informative enough for users… and apologises —and
  here comes the classic Google humour— by explaining that they never
  expected to have to show that error message to anyone. Brilliant. It
  reminds me of the line you can read in the empty “trash” folder of
  their (still beta) webmail service, GMail: “<em>Who needs to delete
  email when you have 1000 MB?</em>”.
</p>
<p>
  The post concludes by advising users to check whether their computers
  are infected with the MyDoom virus.
