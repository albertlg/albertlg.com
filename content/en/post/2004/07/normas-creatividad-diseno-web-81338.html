<p>
  I came across (via <a title="Eric Meyer Weblog" href="http://www.meyerweb.com/" target="_blank">meyerweb.com</a>)
  an <a title="These web sites are identical—or are they?" href="http://phnk.com/design/survey/" target="_blank">interesting study</a>
  carried out by <a title="phnk.com" href="http://phnk.com/" target="_blank">François Briatte</a>.
  In it, he analyses 10 websites (perhaps too small a sample and with
  fairly similar topics: web design weblogs) using a comparative survey
  based on 25 different criteria.<br />

  The conclusion (or rather, the subtitle): “<strong>75% of web design is governed by rules; the rest is merely colours and images</strong>”.
