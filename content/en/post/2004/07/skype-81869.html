<p>Thanks to Eduardo Manchón (<a title="Ainda.info" href="http://www.ainda.info/" target="_blank">Ainda.info</a> and <a title="Alzado.org" href="http://www.alzado.org/" target="_blank">Alzado.org</a>)
I discovered today one of those communication apps that truly
“change your life” — the kind that clearly mark a before and an after.
Skype lets you talk (with surprisingly good quality) and chat using
<acronym title="Peer-To-Peer">P2P</acronym> technology.<br />
I hope to recruit as many friends as possible this week: just think of
the money I’ll save on mobile calls! <strong>;)</strong></p>
<p>Many thanks, Eduardo. Oh! And sorry for interrupting your call… :P</p>
