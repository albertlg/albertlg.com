<p>
  Browsing, browsing… I came across a very interesting article by
  Stephen Covey, in which he explains how to convince the people who
  depend on us to act responsibly.
</p>
<p>
  From Covey’s words, I would like to highlight:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>“<strong>To develop motivation and responsibility, I suggest
  working on two principles that can be very effective: participation
  and trust</strong>”.
  </li>
  <li>“<strong>it requires considerable strength of character, faith
  and patience in the leader</strong>”.
  </li>
  <li>“<strong>trust is the highest form of human motivation</strong>”.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>

  You can read the full article...

      <p>
        “Parents, educators, leaders and managers all share the same
        concern about how to persuade the people who depend on them to
        feel and act responsibly. To develop motivation and
        responsibility, I suggest working on two principles that can
        be very effective: participation and trust.<br>
        <br>
        The first principle is based on involving people in the
        problem and working together to find a solution. The most
        enlightened leaders and managers have begun to adopt this
        principle in one way or another. They have learned that only
        when a person is sincerely involved in a problem can they
        offer the best they have within. When a worker can identify
        their personal goals with those of an institution, an
        enormous flow of energy and creativity emerges.<br>
        <br>
        Why does this principle work? Most of us intuitively know what
        is right, but we often do not feel responsible. However, when
        we are entrusted with some of the facts of a problematic
        situation, we want to help and respond. But when the solution
        to the problem is presented together with the facts, we feel
        deprived of the opportunity to use our own initiative and
        creativity to act, and we resign ourselves to passively
        receiving the consequences of an action.<br>
        <br>
        In this way, responsibility remains with the person who
        proposes the solution. This tends to be repeated many times
        when facing certain problems in which leaders simply do not
        have the time to involve individuals. The solution is often
        already decided, and any attempt to democratize it would be
        insincere. We must be open and influenceable, and we will
        discover an increase in our own power and influence.<br>
        <br>
        It is worth remembering the following: when the nature of the
        solution requires cooperation, commitment and participation
        from others, it is best to first seek the involvement of those
        other individuals in the problem.<br>
        <br>
        In the pursuit of cooperation, commitment and participation,
        it is important not to forget to follow these three steps:<br>
        <br>
        1. <strong>The training process is essential</strong><br>
        Most leaders do not place much trust in this process and
        delegate it. By skipping it, in the long run much more time
        will need to be devoted to external motivation and clarifying
        misunderstandings, which often lead to far more serious
        problems such as strained relationships, personality
        conflicts and low morale.<br>
        <br>
        2. <strong>If training is done well and communication is
        reciprocal, this commitment will be honest and deep</strong><br>
        If training is rushed and communication is one-way and
        limited, commitment will be shallow and will easily disappear
        at the first obstacle or storm.<br>
        <br>
        3. <strong>Once commitment is accepted, the supervisor is a
        source of help, not a judge</strong><br>
        If the person committed to the task fails to deliver, the
        supervisor’s attitude should aim to build a bond of trust and
        offer support.<br>
        <br>
        These three steps are interconnected and reinforce one
        another. Executing them well requires considerable strength
        of character, faith and patience in the leader. Many lack
        this strength, and many workers are so conditioned by constant
        supervision that this philosophy of motivation based on trust
        cannot always be easily implemented. But it is important to
        remember that trust is the highest form of human motivation.”<br>
        <br>
