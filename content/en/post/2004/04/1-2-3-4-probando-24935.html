The title of this first post on my personal weblog, beyond being an initial metaphor as a “sound check”, also serves to inaugurate the site musically. And how could it be otherwise: I’ll do it with the single by the rock band I sing in (or something like that):

<a href="http://www.alteregobcn.com/alone.php" target="_blank" title="AlterEgo - Alone (No More Hate)"><strong>Alone (No More Hate)</strong></a>

<br />
The band is called AlterEgo. ;)

	<p>
	<em>
	All my life<br />
	In a waiting room<br />
	Wishing well<br />
	To rest in peace<br />
	<br />
	All the answers<br />
	That I don't know<br />
	Shining<br />
	When the dreams come true<br />
	<br />
	(Chorus 1: )<br />
	Wake up your ambitions<br />
	No more hate, no more hate now<br />
	Untie all your illusions<br />
	No more hate, no more hate now<br />
	<br />
	Face the world<br />
	All alone<br />
	You're not here<br />
	To win a race<br />
	<br />
	Curse the blame<br />
	But don't give up<br />
	I don't care<br />
	Who I am<br />
	<br />
	(Chorus 2: )<br />
	Forgive your superstitions<br />
	No more hate, no more hate now<br />
	Untie all your illusions<br />
	No more hate, no more hate now<br />
	Feeling all this people<br />
	I forget who I am<br />
	(humming)<br />
	<br />
	(bridge: )<br />
	Listen - my old friend<br />
	You can - take my hand<br />
	All this - loneliness<br />
	Whispers - in your head<br />
	<br />
	Singing - all alone<br />
	In the - darkest room<br />
	To defeat - your fear<br />
	To control - yourself<br />
	<br />
	(Chorus 2 + Breakdown + Guitar solo)
	</em>
