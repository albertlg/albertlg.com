<p>A philosophy I share:</p>
<div class="p-shadow">
  <div>
    <p style="padding-left: 12px; font-size: 1.1em;">
      “<strong>Design</strong> constructs a visual language for the purpose of communication.
      It organizes and gives form to a message in a way that adds
      <strong>value and meaning</strong>. It functions to organize, clarify, persuade,
      and add drama to an otherwise overlooked idea.<br /><br />
      Design plays a primary role in the interpretation of a message.
      It creates the crucial <strong>persistent impression</strong>. It encourages
      examination and generates interest. Accessible, understandable
      information and beauty of form can engage observers and capture
      their attention.<br /><br />
      A confusing, poorly designed message will miss its target almost
      every time. In a world where information flows abundantly, our minds
      have developed filters to sift through the overflow of useless data.
      While design must appeal to aesthetics, it must not interfere with
      delivery, create complications, or introduce obstacles. Instead,
      the presence of design should <strong>simplify and facilitate</strong> everyday
      life, <strong>enable</strong> us to accomplish tasks more effectively, and remind
      us to <strong>enjoy</strong> them along the way.”

I also believe that the presence of design should simplify and facilitate
our daily lives.
