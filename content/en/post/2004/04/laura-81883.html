<p>
By your shore I am able to rebuild waves faster than any ocean, 
able to pump blood for two or for a million, 
to search for your face in every cloud, 
to count the stars one by one, naming them after you, 
to reach the horizon, to forget my own pain, 
to move the world without lever or fulcrum, 
to climb to the highest peak or dive into the deepest depth, 
to lose my pride in your honor, 
to dehydrate myself for your thirst, 
able to drown if you lack air, 
to lose my breath for your desire, 
to stop eating for your hunger, 
to not die for loving you and to die if you do not love me.
</p>
