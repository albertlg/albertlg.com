  <br /><br />
  <strong>8 verses and 1 day</strong>
  <br /><br />
  The morning will ripen into afternoon,<br />
  showing us all its rebellious fire;<br />
  time, like a flame that burns,<br />
  scorching the clock night and day.<br /><br />
  And afternoon will tint itself to night,<br />
  unstoppable, our dance will carry on,<br />
  with love—lavish overflow—<br />
  and the freedom of the breath of air.
</p>
<p><br /> To my flower... and to all the other flowers. ;)</p>
