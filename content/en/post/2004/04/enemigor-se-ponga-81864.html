What would Gila say if he were still around? I think he would go on telling us
<strong>“about the cruelty of men, spoken with the innocence of children”</strong>:

      —Hello? Is this Saddam Hussein? Well, I’m calling to tell you that you
      must destroy your weapons… What do you mean you don’t have any?
      I’m telling you that you do, don’t argue. You’re very stubborn.
      You remind me of my friend Ernesto from the village, who used anthrax
      to kill aphids in his vegetable garden, and of course his tomatoes
      turned blue and Encarni’s son ended up with twenty-four fingers on
      each hand—and he still denied it, the rascal.<br /><br />
      —Hello? Mr. Bush? Yes, listen, I’ve captured an Iraqi prisoner, but I
      don’t know whether he’s one of the good guys or the bad guys, because
      I don’t understand a word he says. Turban? Yes, he’s wearing a turban.
      Rifle? No, no rifle, Mr. President. Mustache? Yes, he’s got a mustache
      and a four-day beard, if that gives you any clue, Mr. President.
      What’s he doing now? Well, right now he’s sitting next to me smoking
      a pipe… Oh! So that means he’s one of the bad guys? You want me to
      arrest him and put a hood over his head so he stops smoking?
      Very well, Mr. President, at your service.
