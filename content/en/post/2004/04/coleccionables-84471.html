<p>Collecting things is an activity that almost everyone, to a greater or lesser extent, has practiced at some point in their life. What usually happens is that most of us eventually give it up when what we collect turns into something useless that ends up gathering dust inside a cupboard (in the best-case scenario). But there are others who keep the hobby alive and even organize meetings to share, with fellow “collection nuts,” their taste for life’s small pleasures.</p>

<p>So we can find collections as unusual as cava bottle caps, sugar packets, telephone cards, (non-winning) ONCE coupons… I know someone who collects beer cans from all over the world, and their collection is truly impressive (I don’t know exactly how many thousands of cans they currently own, but it’s a lot). Personally, I’ve “inherited” my father’s passion for collecting: we collect coins and banknotes—numismatics, I believe it’s called. He also collects stamps; philately, another <em>“nice word”</em>.</p>

<p>Collecting: just another hobby.</p>
