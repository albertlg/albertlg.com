<p>The world of comics is something that captivated me from a very young age (as my friend Sergio likes to say).</p>
<p>From "<strong><em>Mortadelo y Filemón</em></strong>", "<strong><em>El botones Sacarino</em></strong>" and "<strong><em>Chicha, Tato y Clodoveo</em></strong>" (from the magazine <em>Guai!</em>) by the master Ibáñez, to "<strong><em>Mafalda</em></strong>" by Quino, "<strong><em>Garfield</em></strong>" by Jim Davis or "<strong><em>Calvin and Hobbes</em></strong>" by Bill Watterson, and without forgetting my "<strong><em>CIMOC</em></strong>" years (a comics magazine that was always on my bedside table), <strong>superheroes</strong> and <strong>manga</strong>; all the way to "<a title="Spawn" href="http://www.spawn.com/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Spawn</em></strong></a>" by Todd McFarlane and "<a title="The Creech" href="http://www.thecreech.com/" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Creech</em></strong></a>" by Greg Capullo. Together with the brilliance of the line of the erotic artist par excellence <a title="Official website of Milo Manara" href="http://www.milomanara.it/" target="_blank">Milo Manara</a>,
and many others I’m leaving out for now, they form the group of artists and comics that have most influenced me, that I’ve enjoyed, that have entertained, encouraged, thrilled and captivated me… and a loooong etcetera.</p>
<p>No one can deny that comics are an art form, and that art makes you fall in love.</p>
<p>Oh heavens! I forgot "<a title="El Jueves, the magazine that comes out on Wednesdays" href="http://www.eljueves.es/"><strong><em>El Jueves</em></strong></a>"! I would never have forgiven myself… sorry, jester. <strong>;)</strong></p>
