<p>Ask yourselves this about several of the things you were taught to do throughout
your education (which, in my case, I hope never really ends)...
Your own answers may very well surprise you.</p>
<p>This is about the possibility of putting into practice what you’ve worked hard to
learn, even if it was self-taught —or especially so
(I don’t believe in <em>degree-worship</em>)—.</p>
<p>I can think of many possible lines of argument to continue this
post, but I thought it might be better to let your comments
shape that discussion.<br /> What do you think? Shall we begin?</p>
