<p>I openly admit I’m a regular viewer of “<a title="Crónicas Marcianas" href="http://www.cronicasmarcianas.telecinco.es/" target="_blank"><strong>Crónicas Marcianas</strong></a>”.
There isn’t a single night (whenever the show is on, of course) that I
don’t turn on the TV in my bedroom to enjoy what some people consider
trash TV; even so, I find it entertaining and it helps me fall asleep.
Thanks, Sardà.</p>
<p>Thanks as well to the sheer talent of Carlos Latre, the boldness of
Deltell, and the uninhibited yet intelligent glamour of Boris
Izaguirre.</p>
<p>All this despite the fact that the show misuses the concept of “freak”
(at least in my opinion) and despite Rocío Madrid, whose role /
character in the programme I still don’t quite understand.</p>
