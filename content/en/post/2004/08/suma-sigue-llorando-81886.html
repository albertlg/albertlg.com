Because it’s the only thing that comes to mind right now, after coming across this website:
<a title="Iraq Body Count" href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/background_es.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Iraq Body Count</strong></a>,
apart from publishing this post to shake (once again) your consciences...<br />
What justifies a war? Who “wins” a war?
</p>

<p>
If there are <strong>words</strong> that, once spoken, cannot be taken back,

The image of war:
“Thank you for your democracy. Thank you for your freedom.
I have nothing to pay you with, but I’m sure you’ll find a way to collect”.
</p>

<p>
I have always defended forgiveness. Forgive, and do not forget.
