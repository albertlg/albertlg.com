<p>I have translated the original checklist <a title="A Web Standards Checklist" href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/checklist/" target="_blank"><strong>A Web Standards Checklist</strong></a>, from <a title="Web design and graphic design" href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/" target="_blank">MaxDesign</a>.</p>

<p>Before starting, let’s clarify some concepts:</p>

<ul style="font-size: 0.9em;">
<li><strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">What are web standards?</strong><br /><br />
The expression “web standards” can mean different things depending on who you ask. For some, it is nothing more than <strong>building websites without tables</strong>; for others, it means <strong>using valid code</strong>. In any case, the concept is much broader than that. Web standards could be defined as:<br /><br />

<ul style="border-left: 1px solid #cccccc;">
Adherence to standards (<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>, <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym>, <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</acronym>, <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym>, <acronym title="MATHematical Markup Language">MathML</acronym>, <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>, etc.) and the pursuit of best practices (valid code, accessible code, semantically correct code, user-friendly <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>s, etc.).
</ul>

<br />In other words:<br /><br />

<ul style="border-left: 1px solid #cccccc;">
A site built according to web standards should be lightweight, clean, CSS-based, accessible, usable and search-engine friendly.
</ul>
</li>

<br />

<li><strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">About the checklist</strong><br /><br />
This is not a closed list. There are probably many points that could be added. It is simply a starting point. Among its practical uses are:<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>Demonstrating the breadth of web standards.</li>
<li>Serving as a practical tool for developers during the website production phase.</li>
<li>Helping developers who are interested in migrating towards web standards.</li>
</ul>

<br />The checklist is divided into 6 categories:<br /><br />

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Code quality</li>
<li>Degree of separation between content and presentation</li>
<li>User accessibility</li>
<li>Device accessibility</li>
<li>Basic usability</li>
<li>Site management</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
