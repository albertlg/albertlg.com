The different nations of the world should not be measured at the Olympic Games
ONLY by the medals they win. This ranking currently carries an importance
that, in my view, does not truly align with the <strong>Olympic spirit</strong>.<br />
It is part of it, but it is not the whole.
</p>

<p>
There are many other extremely important values, such as sportsmanship,
team spirit (in the case of team sports), humility, self-improvement,
competitiveness, awareness of one’s own limitations, adaptability to
circumstances… which receive far less media attention.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, this does not diminish the importance of efficiency and results,
which in this case are none other than the desired medals. Although there
are victories that receive no reward. <strong>;)</strong>
