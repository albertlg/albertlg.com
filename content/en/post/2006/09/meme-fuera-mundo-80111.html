<p>This <a title="Definition of Meme on Wikipedia" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" target="_blank">meme</a> reached me via <a title="Ruth Gumbau’s blog" href="http://www.ruthgumbau.com/global/global.html" target="_blank">Ruth</a>. Here’s my minute:</p>
<p>If it were the end of the world...</p>
<div class="blogbody"><dt><strong>1. What song would you like to listen to?</strong></dt><br /> <dd><a title="Lyrics of Black, by Pearl Jam" href="http://pearljam.com/songs/song.php?song=Black" target="_blank">“Black” by Pearl Jam</a>... what I’m not sure about is whether I’d rather listen to it or sing it (I did the first yesterday at the <a title="Pearl Jam at the Olympic Pavilion in Badalona - 01/09/2006" href="http://pearljam.com/tour/setlist.php?date=200609012000" target="_blank">Badalona concert</a>, and I’ll do the second tonight at BeGood in Poblenou). ;)</dd> <dt><strong>2. What book would you like to leaf through?</strong></dt><br /> <dd>“Typescript of the Second Origin” by Manuel de Pedrolo—I guess the topic has inspired me.</dd> <dt><strong>3. Who would you like to talk to?</strong></dt><br /> <dd>Someone I love, for sure. But... about what? I don’t know, I don’t know... I think I’d rather have kisses and hugs.</dd> <dt><strong>4. What would you like to eat?</strong></dt><br /> <dd>Three cannelloni: one made by Laura, another by my mother-in-law, and another by my mamma!</dd> <dt><strong>5. What would you do—what do you still have pending?</strong></dt><br /> <dd>Forgetting that the world is ending, the first thing that came to mind was having children; although, if there’s going to be no world... The second would be writing a book; with no one to read it? Well, if it ends, it ends, right?</dd></div>
