<p>What’s more: I’m not ashamed to admit it. :P<br /> The webmaster world is a never-ending cycle of learning and relearning things… maybe that’s why I like it so much. Some even take pride in teaching me something I didn’t know (hey <a title="Rodrigo Mantillán’s blog" href="http://www.pandeblog.net/" target="_blank">Rodrigo</a>?), while others ask me to keep writing more and listening to less music (hey <a title="Tomás Casquero’s blog" href="http://tomcask.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Tito Tommy</a>?).</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the point: launching pop-up windows with JavaScript. It turns out that, regardless of the debate about whether pop-ups should be used at all, there’s a problem that systematically corrupts them, makes them harmful, attacks both advanced and novice users during navigation, confuses search engines, and generates noise in the code. The issue is that, although there are several ways to launch a pop-up using JavaScript, the most commonly used ones are the wrong ones.</p>
<p><strong>The correct way to launch a pop-up window with JavaScript</strong></p>
<blockquote>The following is the code you should use to launch a pop-up:<br /> &lt;a
href="/index.htm" target="_blank" onClick="window.open(this.href,
this.target, 'width=300,height=400'); return false;"&gt;Launch
correctly&lt;/a&gt;<br /> <a onclick="window.open(this.href, this.target, 'width=300,height=400'); return false;" href="http://www.albertlg.com/blog/archivos/archivos/categorias/usabilidad/la_relatividad_de_la_usabilidad.html" target="_blank">Launch correctly</a><br /></blockquote>
<p><br /> Simply change href="/index.htm" to the name of the .htm file you want to open in the new window, and adjust the width and height values according to the desired dimensions (in pixels).</p>
