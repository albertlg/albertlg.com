<p>
I first wrote this post in 2006, when <em>eye-tracking</em> studies were reshaping our understanding of how people actually looked at Google’s search results. The internet was a different universe: no mobile, no AI, no rich snippets — and a very young Google.
</p>

<p>
Even so, the iconic <strong>Google Search Golden Triangle</strong> became one of the most influential heatmaps in SEO history. And although it has aged (as have we all since 2006), it still teaches something essential: <strong>attention is limited, and humans focus where value appears instantly.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. The original “Golden Triangle”: when everything happened in the top-left corner</h2>

<p>
The study — powered by early eye-tracking technology — revealed a consistent pattern: users scanned the results page forming a triangle concentrated in the upper left area.
</p>

  </a>
</p>

<p><strong>Visibility by position (2006):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Rank 1: 100%</li>
  <li>Rank 2: 100%</li>
  <li>Rank 3: 100%</li>
  <li>Rank 4: 85%</li>
  <li>Rank 5: 60%</li>
  <li>Rank 6: 50%</li>
  <li>Rank 7: 50%</li>
  <li>Rank 8: 30%</li>
  <li>Rank 9: 30%</li>
  <li>Rank 10: 20%</li>
</ul>

<p>
In other words: <strong>ranking high wasn’t just beneficial — it was decisive.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. What has changed since then (and why the triangle isn’t a triangle anymore)</h2>

<p>
Google is no longer a simple list of blue links. Today it’s a mosaic: AI answers, videos, maps, FAQs, carousels, product listings, and layouts that didn’t exist two decades ago.
</p>

<p>
Then came mobile — and with it, a new behaviour pattern: less triangle, more <strong>fast vertical scanning</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>Today, user behaviour tends to be:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>vertical,</li>
  <li>block-based,</li>
  <li>influenced by visual elements,</li>
  <li>shaped by answers that “solve” before a click is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yet the core truth remains: <strong>the top positions still concentrate most of the attention.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. The other Golden Triangle: the three foundational SEO pillars</h2>

<p>
The term “Golden Triangle” also describes the three essential components of any solid SEO strategy:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>On-Page SEO:</strong> content, intent, HTML, architecture.</li>
  <li><strong>Off-Page SEO:</strong> authority, mentions, backlinks.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> speed, indexing, accessibility, structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If any of these pillars fails, rankings become unstable. If all three work together, everything else gets easier.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Why the Golden Triangle still matters in 2026</h2>

<p>
Because it brings together two timeless truths:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>how humans look at information</strong></li>
  <li><strong>and how we optimise so they can find us.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
SERP layouts evolve. Human nature… not so much.
</p>

<p>
With AI-generated answers now in the mix, SEO also depends on <strong>semantic visibility</strong>: mentions, entities, presence in models and summaries.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5. Personal closing (2026)</h2>

<p>
Re-reading this post almost twenty years later reminded me how much SEO has changed — and how the essentials haven’t: <strong>understanding people before understanding algorithms.</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Golden Triangle may no longer have sharp edges, but its lesson survives: the game of attention still starts in the same place — wherever someone looks first.
