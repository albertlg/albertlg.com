<p>Let me introduce <a title="Wacom Graphire4 Classic XL" href="http://www.wacom-europe.com/int/products/graphire4/index.asp?lang=es&amp;pdx=12" target="_blank">my new “toy”</a>:</p>
<p align="center"><img style="margin: 4px; vertical-align: middle;" src="/img/post/graphire4.jpg" alt="Wacom Graphire4 Classic XL" width="360" height="216" /></p>
<p>With it, I hope to get started in the world of comic strips, high-quality photo retouching, and more. In short, <strong>to pick up my drawing hobby again</strong>—or “coloring and painting,” as they say at work.<br /> It seems that a great companion for the graphics tablet could be the software <a title="Autodesk Sketchbook Pro" href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=6848332&amp;siteID=123112" target="_blank">Autodesk Sketchbook Pro</a> (previously from <a title="Autodesk completes the acquisition of Alias" href="http://www.autodesk.es/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=455755&amp;id=6479561" target="_blank">Alias, which has been acquired by Autodesk</a>).</p>
