<p>The title of this post could be a pretty good “geek” definition of this blog...</p>
<p>So much “geek”, so much “geek”... but what the heck does “geek” actually mean?<br /> Well, on Wikipedia you can find <a title="Geek on Wikipedia" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek" target="_blank">a definition of geek</a>... and just when things weren’t confusing enough, along comes <a title="Nerd on Wikipedia" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd" target="_blank">the word “nerd”</a>.<br /> Luckily, I’m supposed to be a bit like that anyway... you know, man. ¬_¬'</p>
<p>By the way, I’ve already put the Wacom Graphire4 Classic XL to use, with a sketch based on a photograph of my friends Ray and Stefa:</p>
<p align="center"><img class="fotobonita" style="margin: 4px; vertical-align: middle;" src="/img/post/ray-stefa.jpg" alt="Ray &amp; Stefa sketch" width="360" height="280" /></p>
<p>I didn’t quite do them justice, but you have to start somewhere... ;)</p>
