<p>I had read this some time ago, but I feel like bringing it up again:</p>
<div class="p-shadow">
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 12px; font-size: 1em;">During a group dynamics exercise for a multinational company, three candidates were asked the following question:<br /> <strong>What would you like people to say about you at your funeral?</strong><br /> The first candidate said:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;- That I was a great doctor and a very good family man.<br /> The second candidate said:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;- That I was a wonderful man, an excellent family man, and a teacher who had a great influence on the future of young people.<br /> But the third candidate stole the show:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;- I’d like them to say... Look, he’s moving!!<br /> That’s optimism... He got the job!</p>
