<p style="padding-left: 12px; font-size: 1em;"><strong>“You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson. You believe you are special, that for some reason the rules do not apply to you. Obviously, you are mistaken. This company is one of the largest software companies in the world. Every employee understands that he or she is part of a whole. Therefore, if one employee has a problem, the company has a problem as well. You will have to make a decision, Mr. Anderson (...) or you will have to start looking for another job. Have I made myself clear?”</strong></p>
