<p>... musical ones, and nicely chained together. ;)<br /> After immersing myself in the musical evolution of “<a title="Days Of The New" href="http://www.daysofthenew.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Days Of The New</strong></a>”
across their three color-themed albums (Orange, Green, and Red), all very guitar-driven,
I stumbled upon (thanks, Hugo) another pleasant surprise in the musical
scene (I’d always wanted to say/write “musical scene”... hehe):
the New York City band “<a title="Antony And The Johnsons" href="http://www.antonyandthejohnsons.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Antony And The Johnsons</strong></a>”.<br />
Then I talked to my friend Ray, who told me to listen to “<a title="Rufus Wainwright" href="http://www.rufuswainwright.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Rufus Wainwright</strong></a>”. Not bad at all.</p>
<p>All this while, I’m now listening to the “<a title="White Stripes" href="http://www.whitestripes.com/" target="_blank"><strong>White Stripes</strong></a>”, with their “Blue Orchid”… excellent.</p>
