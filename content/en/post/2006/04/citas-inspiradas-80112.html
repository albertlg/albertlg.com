<p style="padding-left: 12px; font-size: 1em;"><strong>“Afterwards is now.”</strong><br />Ray; doctor.<br /><br /><strong>“Time passes in moments... moments which, in the blink of an eye, define the course of our lives as surely as they carry them toward their end. We rarely stop to analyze whether the path we take is the result of our own decisions or whether we simply let ourselves fall into it with our eyes closed. But what if we could stop—pause each precise moment before it happens? Would we be able to see the countless forks in the road that shape our lives? And faced with so many options, would we choose a different path?”</strong><br />Scully – All time – 7x17.</p>
