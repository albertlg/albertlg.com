<p>Today I turn 28... and I’ve learned that it’s one of the 39 known <strong>perfect numbers</strong>.<br /> <strong>What is a perfect number?</strong> One whose proper divisors (excluding itself) add up to the number itself.<br /> Like this: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = <strong>28</strong>.</p>

<p>By the way, many thanks, Javi (for the congratulations and for the curious and interesting bit of information). ;)</p>
