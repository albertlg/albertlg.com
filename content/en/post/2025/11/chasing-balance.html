<p><em>I’ve reached an age where time is no longer measured in years but in cycles.</em></p>
<p><em>Cycles that repeat, transform, intertwine.</em></p>
<p><em>Cycles of work and rest, effort and pause, loss and rediscovery.</em></p>

<p>The world I knew as a child —slower, more analog, more innocent— has become a stream that never stops.<br>
Data, screens, noise, speed.<br>
And yet, amid so much change, I keep searching for the same thing my parents and their parents sought: balance.<br>
Not as a goal, but as a way of being in the world.</p>

<p>I’ve learned that balance is not achieved, it’s pursued.<br>
Like a ball that bounces and returns, like a melody that seems to resolve but stays open.<br>
Like a garden that only bears fruit if you care for it day after day: sowing, watering, weeding, feeding, waiting.<br>
And doing it with care, with attention, with the patience of someone who knows that time has its own rhythm.<br>
Constant effort is what gives meaning to the result —not the other way around.</p>

<p>Sport taught me much of this.<br>
In basketball, you learn quickly that the team comes before the self.<br>
You pass the ball, cover your teammate, sprint back on defense even when your body asks for air.<br>
Win together, lose together, rise together.<br>
Balance between ambition and generosity, between wanting to stand out and knowing when to yield, between talent and discipline.<br>
The same balance that, over time, you try to apply to everything else.</p>

<p>Music reminds me of it too.<br>
Playing with others —whether it’s rock, jazz, or simple improvisation— means understanding that perfect sound doesn’t exist if everyone plays for themselves.<br>
You have to listen.<br>
Find the tempo, the volume, the space.<br>
Harmony isn’t born from perfection, but from mutual listening.<br>
And when everything fits, when the chords cross in the air naturally, you realize that such beauty is only possible because there was chaos, rehearsal, silence, and error before it.</p>

<p>It’s the same with almost everything.<br>
In work, in love, in life.<br>
I’ve built projects and worked for others.<br>
I’ve led and followed.<br>
I’ve saved, invested, and learned —sometimes late— that value isn’t always measured in money, but in freedom, in time, in coherence.<br>
And that humility is the best antidote to the arrogance of thinking you already know enough.</p>

<p>We live in strange times: the climate is unraveling, machines are learning, and screens reflect more of us than they reveal.<br>
Yet, amid the vertigo, I still believe that what matters endures:<br>
the need to think for oneself, to learn without fear, to love without envy, to celebrate others’ success and learn from it.<br>
The need to keep our feet on the ground —literally—, to get our hands dirty, to breathe real air and not just information.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder what kind of world my daughters will inherit.<br>
And then I remember that our parents wondered the same, with different worries and the same fears.<br>
Humanity has always lived between crisis and hope.<br>
The trick, if there is one, is not to let change put us to sleep.<br>
To stay awake.<br>
Critical.<br>
Aware.<br>
With eyes open to the forest, the river, the sky —and also inward.</p>

<p>Because what truly matters is not surviving change, but doing so with love and awareness.<br>
With meaning.<br>
Understanding that every gesture, however small —watering a plant, passing a ball, striking a note, listening to someone nearby— is part of something greater.</p>

<p>In the end, balance isn’t found.<br>
It’s practiced.<br>
And even if it’s impossible to achieve completely, pursuing it keeps us alive.<br>
Keeps us human.</p>

<p>Let the cycle continue.<br>
But let it continue awake.</p>
