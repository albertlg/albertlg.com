<p><em>There isn’t a single resume. There are as many as there are perspectives. Today I’m not summarizing my career — I’m deconstructing it. Because depending on who’s looking, my story changes. Here are my versions.</em></p>
<p><em>Or how the same work history can be reimagined like a Black Mirror episode told by ex-bosses, your ego, and your teenage self.</em></p>

<h2>🏛️ According to a political party</h2>
<p>
Deep voice, crisp blazer, campaign smile.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resume:</strong> PhD in Digital Strategy from the University of Life, with a multidisciplinary background in leadership, technology, and applied innovation. Founder, mentor, manager, and transformer. A benchmark in internationalization and public investment policies.
</p>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> None of this is untrue. But if you told me this, I wouldn’t buy it either.</p>

<p>Alternative versions available upon request:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Conservative party version:</strong> Expert in digital order and tradition. Solid experience leading projects that never go off-script. Family values, homeland pride, and well-structured data.</li>
	<li><strong>Progressive party version:</strong> Inclusive web usability activist. Digital transformation with a conscience. Open source advocate and purposeful innovator.</li>
	<li><strong>Populist party version:</strong> Honest résumé, like yours. Not an expert — just one of you. But I know how this works better than the so-called experts.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> As many titles as there are flags waving.</p>

<h2>😰 According to Impostor Syndrome</h2>
<p>
Shaky inner voice, always lowercase.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resume:</strong> I’ve spent 20 years trying not to disappoint anyone. Sometimes I succeed. Sometimes not. I’ve got training, experience, clients… but I still wonder if I’m good enough. Did I earn this or just get lucky?
</p>
<p>I’ve done stuff, but not sure it really counts. I’ve worked with big companies, though maybe I just happened to be in the right place. Sometimes I don’t even know how I got here.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> Never the smartest in the room. Even when I look like I am. What if tomorrow someone finds out I’m not who my résumé says I am?</p>

<h2>💼 According to my ego (LinkedIn mode ON)</h2>
<p>
Epic tone, city skyline background at night.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resume:</strong> Digital growth architect. Ex-Softonic, Co-founder of Uvinum (exit), currently leading Mindset Digital. Speaker, mentor, strategist. 20+ years driving brand-transforming projects. Always 10 steps ahead. Sometimes 11.
</p>
<p>Pioneer. Visionary. Creator of strategies that reshaped SEO in Spain. Natural leader. Spiritual founder of more than one trend. A benchmark for those who followed. And yes: humble.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> Behind every success lies hours of WordPress. It’s not about the truth, but how well it ranks. Too much talent to fit in one page — but here goes.</p>

<h2>🧳 According to my fellow travelers</h2>
<p>
Plural voice, full of camaraderie and anecdotes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resume:</strong> The one who puts the puzzle together until everything fits. The one who shows up with ideas no one saw coming — and makes them happen. The one who gets his hands dirty. The one who says “what if we do it differently?” just when everything seemed done.
</p>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> Sometimes also the one who runs so far ahead, someone has to pull him back.</p>

<p>Real quotes from people I’ve worked with:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Montserrat Peñarroya:</strong> “An excellent professional. A pleasure to work with. Creative, innovative, hardworking — and a genuinely good person.”</li>
  <li><strong>Alejandro Ramírez:</strong> “A true SEO and digital expert. Always impeccable work and an admirable attitude towards challenges.”</li>
  <li><strong>Maria Franquesa:</strong> “Albert is an outstanding professional and a great human being. Creative, and a true team player. A valuable asset to any group.”</li>
	<li><strong>Albert Garcia:</strong> “Persistent and creative, always finding solutions. Highly responsible. A generous teammate and collaborator. Undoubtedly, a real SEO expert.”</li>
	<li><strong>Javier Ferrer:</strong> “Brings deep experience in the digital world, attention to detail, and a thoughtful touch. Responsible yet approachable — and a great team motivator.”</li>
  <li><strong>Carlos Ortega:</strong> “Albert has unmatched SEO fundamentals and project experience. His results speak for themselves (Softonic, Uvinum...). But after working with him for over a year, I can confirm: he knows how and when to apply those skills. Combine that with empathy, trust, delegation, and communication — and you’ve got a great team leader.”</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> You’re not what you say about yourself — but what others remember you for.</p>

<h2>🧠 According to my therapist</h2>
<p>
Calm tone. Even the silence says something.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resume:</strong> Professional with a tendency to overexert, self-demanding, who’s learned to turn work into refuge. Absorbs everything. Really listens. Needs to be reminded, from time to time, that there’s nothing to prove — to others or himself.
</p>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> It’s okay to be tired. It’s okay to pause.</p>

<h2>📚 According to my daughters</h2>
<p>
Proud voices, even if they won’t say it that way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resume:</strong> Daddy knows a lot about the internet. And Google stuff. And AI. And he writes. And sometimes people ask him for help with weird things. And he sings. And he used to coach basketball. And he drives us to practices, games, and tournaments. And he draws. And always asks how our day was.
</p>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> They’ve seen me type more than sleep. Not sure if that’s a good thing.</p>

<h2>🧑‍🎓 According to my 18-year-old self</h2>
<p>
Hopeful voice. Dreams and vertigo.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resume:</strong> Will I really get to make a living doing what I love? Will I have my own company? Will I work from home, on weird schedules, with projects that reach the world? Will I meet people who challenge and admire me? Will I have daughters? Will I still be writing?
</p>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> You didn’t know if you’d make it. But here we are.</p>

<h2>📋 According to the HR spreadsheet</h2>
<p>
Soulless tone. Columns. Filters. Numbers.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Name:</strong> López, Albert</li>
  <li><strong>Position:</strong> SEO Manager / Cofounder</li>
  <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Digital Marketing</li>
  <li><strong>Experience:</strong> 25 years</li>
  <li><strong>Skills:</strong> SEO, strategy, content, AI, leadership</li>
  <li><strong>Employee ID:</strong> 001178-AL</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> Doesn’t show your doubts or sleepless nights — but hey, it’s exportable to PDF.</p>

<h2>📎 According to an AI algorithm</h2>
<p>
Monotone voice. Based on structured data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resume:</strong> Profile identified as Senior Marketing Professional with expertise in SEO, analytics, applied AI, and project management. High success probability in entrepreneurial environments and small, horizontal teams. Medium-high relevance in Spanish-speaking digital innovation searches.
</p>
<p>Albert L.G.: SEO Specialist | AI Integrator | Digital Strategist | 80+ projects | 947K+ organic sessions generated | 100% data-driven | 🤖</p>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> AI still struggles to see the soul between tags. The man who trained machines, before they replaced him.</p>

<h2>🟫 According to me in 20 years (retired, hopefully)</h2>
<p>
Reflective voice, from the future.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resume:</strong> I’ve been many versions of myself. Some shone on LinkedIn. Others only in my daughters’ eyes. The best résumé was never printed — it was written in time, values, and attention.
</p>
<p><em>Sidebar:</em> My most important title? Lifelong learner.</p>

<h2>🧭 Final thought: Who’s writing your story? The real resume</h2>
<p>
No résumé tells the full truth. Some idealize. Some diminish. All of them edit. But maybe what matters isn’t the layout or the fanciest title… but the awareness that we’re made of many versions of ourselves. And they all belong to us.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t about rewriting my past — it’s about opening it up. Making it porous. Human. Because even when we talk about work, we’re really talking about who we are.
</p>
<p>
None of these résumés is entirely true. Or maybe all of them are. Because truth — like SEO — depends on context. And me? I’m still under construction.
</p>

<p><strong>And you — which version of your story do you want to write today?</strong></p>
