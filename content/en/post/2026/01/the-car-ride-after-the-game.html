<p><em>Not everything that matters happens during the game.</em><br>
Sometimes, what leaves the deepest mark happens afterwards.</p>

<p>On the drive home.<br>
When adrenaline fades.<br>
When the noise dies down.<br>
When there’s no audience anymore.</p>

<p>The car then becomes a peculiar space.<br>
Closed.<br>
Shared.<br>
With no escape.</p>

<h2>Silence plays too</h2>

<p>There’s an almost automatic temptation:<br>
to fill that space.</p>

<p>To analyse.<br>
To correct.<br>
To explain.<br>
To repeat what was already seen from the stands.</p>

<p>But saying nothing is sometimes the best option.<br>
At times, what matters most is <strong>letting silence do its work</strong>.</p>

<p>Silence allows the experience to settle.<br>
Emotions to reorganise.<br>
The person to process what happened at their own pace.</p>

<h2>What to say… and what not to say</h2>

<p>This isn’t about never speaking.<br>
It’s about choosing the right moment and the right words.</p>

<p>Some phrases tend to help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“How did you feel?”</li>
  <li>“What was the best part today?”</li>
  <li>“If you want, we can talk about it later.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Others, even if well intentioned, usually don’t help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“You should have…”</li>
  <li>“From the outside I saw that…”</li>
  <li>“You always do the same thing.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Not because they’re false.<br>
But because <strong>it’s not the moment</strong>.</p>

<h2>Accompanying is not directing</h2>

<p>The drive back isn’t a technical talk.<br>
Nor an evaluation.</p>

<p>It’s a space for accompaniment.</p>

<p>Accompanying means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listening more than speaking.</li>
  <li>Validating emotions before results.</li>
  <li>Respecting the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Directing, on the other hand, often comes from haste.<br>
From discomfort with mistakes.<br>
Or from the desire to protect… by intruding.</p>

<p>The difference is noticeable.<br>
And remembered.</p>

<h2>Learning isn’t always immediate</h2>

<p>Not all learning happens in the heat of the moment.<br>
Nor does it always need words.</p>

<p>Sometimes it appears hours later.<br>
Or the next day.<br>
Or in the next practice.</p>

<p>Forcing it during the car ride often has the opposite effect:<br>
closing instead of opening.</p>

<p>Patient accompaniment leaves room for reflection to emerge on its own.</p>

<h2>The adult learns too</h2>

<p>This drive isn’t formative only for the one who played.<br>
It is also formative for the one who accompanies.</p>

<p>Learning to stay quiet.<br>
To wait.<br>
To trust.</p>

<p>It’s not easy.<br>
But it’s part of the role.</p>

<h2>Heading home</h2>

<p>The car keeps moving.<br>
The city reappears.<br>
Life goes on.</p>

<p>Maybe not much was said.<br>
And yet, something important happened.</p>

<p>Because accompanying well doesn’t always leave a visible trace.<br>
But it almost always leaves a memory.</p>

<p><strong>And in the long run, that’s what truly matters.</strong></p>
