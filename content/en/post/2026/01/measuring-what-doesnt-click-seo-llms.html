<p><em>There was a time when measuring SEO was relatively simple.</em><br>
Organic traffic, rankings, CTR, conversions.<br>
Imperfect, yes. But understandable.</p>

<p>Today, that framework falls short.</p>

<p>Not because SEO has stopped working, but because <strong>user behaviour has changed</strong>… and with it, the role search engines and language models play.</p>

<p>In many contexts, the answer no longer leads to a click.<br>
And yet, <strong>the influence is still there</strong>.</p>

<h2>The problem isn’t the lack of data — it’s the mental model</h2>

<p>When LLMs, generated answers and AI Overviews show up, the first reaction is often defensive:<br>
<em>“We’re losing traffic.”</em></p>

<p>Sometimes that’s true.<br>
But it’s not the most important question.</p>

<p>The real question is:<br>
<strong>are we measuring the right kind of impact for this new environment?</strong></p>

<p>For years, we’ve confused <em>clicks</em> with <em>value</em>.<br>
Now that clicks don’t always happen, we’ve lost our compass.</p>

<h2>When visibility doesn’t end on your website</h2>

<p>Language models don’t browse like people do.<br>
They don’t compare ten tabs.<br>
They don’t scroll.</p>

<p><strong>They synthesise.</strong><br>
And in doing so, they decide which sources, brands and concepts shape the answer.</p>

<p>That introduces a deep shift:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your content can influence without getting visits.</li>
  <li>Your brand can appear without being linked.</li>
  <li>Your authority can grow without showing up in Analytics.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we only look at traffic, the diagnosis will always be incomplete.</p>

<h2>KPIs that still matter (even without a click)</h2>

<p>There’s no magic dashboard for SEO in the LLM era.<br>
But there are <strong>cumulative signals</strong> that, when read together, tell a fairly clear story.</p>

<h3>1. Brand demand (direct and assisted)</h3>

<p>When a brand starts showing up as a reference in generated answers, something interesting often happens:<br>
<strong>branded search grows</strong>.</p>

<p>Not always immediately or linearly.<br>
But it’s one of the strongest indicators of real impact.</p>

<p>Not because the user clicked before, but because <em>they saw you</em>.</p>

<h3>2. Share of voice in hybrid SERPs</h3>

<p>It’s no longer enough to measure classic rankings.<br>
You also need to watch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Presence in featured snippets.</li>
  <li>Mentions inside AI Overviews.</li>
  <li>Visibility in extended generated answers.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not trivial to measure, but it’s measurable with method and consistency.<br>
And, most importantly, with context.</p>

<h3>3. Unlinked mentions (brand citations)</h3>

<p>For years, unlinked mentions were treated as “secondary”.<br>
Today, they’re a key signal.</p>

<p>Language models rely on semantic and reputational patterns.<br>
<strong>Being cited matters, even without a link.</strong></p>

<h3>4. “Dark” leads</h3>

<p>It’s a pattern we’re seeing more and more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Traffic doesn’t grow.</li>
  <li>Opportunities do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Leads that arrive saying:<br>
<em>“I saw you recommended.”</em><br>
<em>“You showed up in an answer.”</em><br>
<em>“Your name rang a bell.”</em></p>

<p>No UTM will capture that.<br>
But ignoring it would be a mistake.</p>

<h2>Measuring SEO for LLMs means accepting imperfection</h2>

<p>One of the uncomfortable truths of this stage is simple:<br>
<strong>not everything will be perfectly attributable.</strong></p>

<p>There will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More influence than traceability.</li>
  <li>More accumulation than spikes.</li>
  <li>More brand than isolated keywords.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that requires maturity — especially in environments where reporting has always been surgical.</p>

<h2>What is definitely a mistake</h2>

<p>There are two common reactions that, in my view, don’t help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deny the shift and keep measuring as if nothing has changed.</li>
  <li>Embrace fuzzy metrics without judgement or context.</li>
</ul>

<p>No nostalgia. No blind faith.</p>

<p>What we need now is to <strong>think better about what we measure — and why</strong>.</p>

<h2>Fine-tuning</h2>

<p>At its core, this debate isn’t only about SEO or artificial intelligence.<br>
It’s about something broader:</p>

<p><strong>learning how to evaluate impact in complex systems</strong>.</p>

<p>When results aren’t immediate.<br>
When influence isn’t always visible.<br>
When value doesn’t fit into a single metric.</p>

<p>For years we fine-tuned models built for a world of clicks.<br>
Now we need to fine-tune how we listen.</p>

<p>Look beyond traffic.<br>
Treat brand as a cumulative asset.<br>
Accept that not everything can be attributed — but almost everything can be interpreted.</p>

<p>Measuring what doesn’t click isn’t about lowering standards.<br>
It’s about raising the level of judgement.</p>

<p><strong>And in 2026, that starts to make a real difference.</strong></p>
