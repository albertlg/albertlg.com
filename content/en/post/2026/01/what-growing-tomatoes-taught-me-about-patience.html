<p><em>The first time I planted tomatoes on the terrace, I thought it would be simple: soil, sun, water… and wait.</em></p>
<p><em>Then I learned that tomatoes have their own calendar—and their own way of teaching you things.</em></p>

<p>That small garden has become a yearly reminder about patience, rhythm and expectations. Every season, a few tomatoes put me back in my place.</p>

<h2>1. They grow when they grow (not when you want them to)</h2>

<p>More water doesn’t speed them up.<br>
Checking them every morning doesn’t help.<br>
Moving the pots around obsessively… even less.</p>

<p>The garden taught me something I often forget outside of it: <strong>some processes can’t be pushed</strong>. You can care for them, but you can’t impose your internal deadlines.</p>

<p>And once you accept that, something loosens. You enjoy the process more, and the date less. A lesson that applies to tomatoes, but also to projects, personal changes and almost anything that matters.</p>

<h2>2. If the system is well built, you don’t need to micromanage</h2>

<p>Obsessing over every leaf does nothing if the system isn’t solid: good soil, drainage, orientation, and a stake for support.</p>

<p>The same happens at work: if everything depends on you being on top of it every day, <strong>you don’t have a system—you have sustained urgency</strong>.</p>

<p>In the garden it’s obvious: once the setup is right, all you do is water, observe and correct small issues. The rest is done by the plant. In projects, teams or even at home, building “good pots” (supportive environments) changes everything.</p>

<h2>3. Pruning isn’t punishment: it creates space</h2>

<p>At first it hurts to cut a healthy-looking branch. It feels like slowing things down. Until you realise that <strong>pruning doesn’t reduce energy—it redirects it</strong>.</p>

<p>Once you remove branches that only consume resources, the plant strengthens: fewer unnecessary leaves, more potential fruit.</p>

<p>Outside the garden, the metaphor is obvious: removing tasks, commitments or ideas creates room for what matters. It’s not being less ambitious; it’s being more honest about what you can truly take care of.</p>

<h2>4. Every plant has its own rhythm (just like people)</h2>

<p>Same pots, same soil, same water, same light… and still, each plant moves at its own pace.</p>

<p>One grows fast, one looks stuck, another wakes up out of nowhere weeks later. It’s not a mistake—it’s their rhythm.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder why it’s harder to accept this outside the garden: <strong>not everyone matures, decides or changes at the pace you prefer</strong>. And your role isn’t to sync anyone, but to accompany without suffocating.</p>

<h2>5. The reward isn’t just the perfect tomato</h2>

<p>You expect the highlight to be harvesting the first bright red tomato. And it’s nice, of course. But the real value was in the process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seeing the seed break through the soil</li>
  <li>the first stem holding itself upright</li>
  <li>yellow flowers blooming without warning</li>
  <li>the green fruit slowly changing colour</li>
</ul>

<p>The process slows you down, reminds you that <strong>time is an ingredient, not an obstacle</strong>, and reconnects you with something basic we tend to forget when everything runs at 1.5x speed.</p>

<h2>6. What the tomatoes remind me every year</h2>

<p>If I had to summarise it, it would look like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not everything depends on me (and sometimes that’s a relief).</li>
  <li>Well-designed systems matter more than willpower alone.</li>
  <li>“Pruning” tasks, notifications or expectations improves almost everything.</li>
  <li>Honouring rhythms—your own and others’—is a form of respect.</li>
  <li>The fruits arrive… just rarely on the day I imagined.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe that’s why I keep planting tomatoes every year.<br>
Not just for the tomatoes, but for the way they remind me <strong>how I want to live</strong>: with less rush, more care and a lot more patience.</p>
