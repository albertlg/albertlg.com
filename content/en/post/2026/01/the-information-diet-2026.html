<p><em>The problem is no longer a lack of information.</em><br>
It’s excess.</p>

<p>News, opinions, alerts, newsletters, threads, videos, automated summaries.<br>
And now, on top of that, systems generating content nonstop.</p>

<p>The question in 2026 isn’t <em>where to get informed</em>.<br>
It’s something far more uncomfortable:</p>

<p><strong>what truly deserves our attention?</strong></p>

<h2>More information doesn’t mean more judgement</h2>

<p>Constant exposure creates the feeling of being up to date.<br>
But it often weakens understanding.</p>

<p>When everything demands importance,<br>
nothing really carries weight.</p>

<h2>AI didn’t create the noise (it made it visible)</h2>

<p>Language models didn’t invent saturation.<br>
They accelerated it.</p>

<p>Today, generating summaries, analyses, and opinions takes seconds.<br>
That’s powerful.<br>
And risky.</p>

<p>Not because the technology is bad,<br>
but because it <strong>makes it easier to consume without digesting</strong>.</p>

<p>Reading a summary isn’t understanding.<br>
Getting an answer isn’t thinking.</p>

<h2>Simplifying isn’t disconnecting</h2>

<p>Simplifying an information diet doesn’t mean withdrawing from the world.<br>
It means choosing.</p>

<p>Choosing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fewer sources, but better known</li>
  <li>less immediacy, more context</li>
  <li>less reaction, more pause</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal isn’t consuming less for its own sake.<br>
It’s <strong>consuming better</strong>.</p>

<h2>Some practical adjustments</h2>

<p>There’s no universal formula, but conscious decisions make a difference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not following those who only create urgency.</li>
  <li>Reducing how often you check, not just what you check.</li>
  <li>Separating information from entertainment.</li>
  <li>Returning to long-form reading, even when it’s harder.</li>
  <li>Leaving spaces without stimuli.</li>
</ul>

<p>Judgement is built in the gaps too.</p>

<h2>Fewer inputs, better questions</h2>

<p>When noise drops, something interesting happens:<br>
questions improve.</p>

<p>It’s no longer about reacting quickly.<br>
Or having an opinion on everything.</p>

<p>It’s about understanding better.<br>
Connecting ideas.<br>
Spotting patterns.</p>

<p>No feed gives you that.</p>

<h2>Choosing what stays out</h2>

<p>In 2026, one of the most underrated skills is knowing when to close doors.</p>

<p>Not everything deserves to be read.<br>
Not everything deserves a response.<br>
Not everything deserves an opinion.</p>

<p>Ignoring isn’t indifference.<br>
It’s a form of care.</p>

<h2>In the end, it’s about energy</h2>

<p>Attention is limited.<br>
So is mental energy.</p>

<p>Taking care of your information diet isn’t an intellectual gesture.<br>
It’s a practical decision to think better, work better, and live with more calm.</p>

<p>In an environment that pushes constant consumption,<br>
simplifying isn’t going against the world.</p>

<p><strong>It’s choosing how to be in it.</strong></p>
