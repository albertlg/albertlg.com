<p><em>It wasn’t planned.</em><br>
Like most things that truly matter.</p>

<p>At some point during our family drives —games, practices, short trips— the car stopped being just a means of transport.<br>
It became something else.</p>

<p>A shared space.<br>
A place where things happen.</p>

<h2>Music in motion</h2>

<p>Music was always there.<br>
But now it plays a different role.</p>

<p>Shared Spotify playlists.<br>
Improvised DJ turns.<br>
Songs someone plays “just because” and someone else discovers without looking for them.</p>

<p>And above all, singing.<br>
Badly, well, halfway.<br>
Together.</p>

<p>The car has something special:<br>
no stage, no judgement, no rehearsal beforehand.<br>
Just presence.</p>

<h2>Listening before choosing</h2>

<p>Over time, I’ve noticed something curious.<br>
In the car, almost without trying, we practise a rare skill:</p>

<p><strong>listening before deciding.</strong></p>

<p>Listening to what’s playing.<br>
Listening to what someone else suggests.<br>
Listening without skipping after ten seconds.</p>

<p>You don’t always like everything.<br>
That’s fine.</p>

<p>Sometimes you discover something new.<br>
Other times, you simply respect the turn.</p>

<p>And in that small gesture, there is learning.</p>

<h2>Learning without giving lessons</h2>

<p>No speeches.<br>
No explicit moral.</p>

<p>Yet important things happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>References are shared.</li>
  <li>Taste is shaped.</li>
  <li>Difference is normalised.</li>
  <li>Living with it becomes natural.</li>
</ul>

<p>Music acts as a mediator.<br>
It doesn’t confront, impose or correct.</p>

<p>It accompanies.</p>

<h2>AI has a place here too</h2>

<p>At home there are instruments, gadgets, and now AI tools to play with music.<br>
Suno included.</p>

<p>Not as a replacement.<br>
As a creative toy.</p>

<p>Another way to explore, to experiment, to laugh at the result.<br>
To understand that technology amplifies, but doesn’t replace what happens when we truly share something.</p>

<h2>Fine-tuning</h2>

<p>Maybe that’s why the car has become a kind of rehearsal room.</p>

<p>Not because everything sounds perfect.<br>
But because something important is practised there:</p>

<p>listening,<br>
waiting,<br>
respecting turns,<br>
fine-tuning together.</p>

<p>Almost without noticing.</p>

<p>And sometimes —just sometimes—<br>
the song fits.<br>
And the drive feels short.</p>
