<img class="fotobonita" style="margin: 4px;" title="AP-AP" src="/img/post/ap-ap.png" alt="Father watching a basketball game from the stands" width="720" />

<p>I don’t coach.<br>
I don’t set the lineups.<br>
I don’t decide minutes or systems.</p>

<p>I’m a dad.<br>
And I’m in the stands.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve learned many things watching basketball from outside the court. Some technical, many emotional. But above all, I’ve learned that <strong>a team is not built only on the court</strong>. It’s also built in the stands, in the hallways, in the car rides home, and in the conversations afterward.</p>

<p>That’s where this simple —and not easy— idea comes from, shared among some of the parents:</p>

<p><strong>AP-AP: Add or Step Aside.</strong></p>

<h2>What it means to “add”</h2>

<p>Adding doesn’t mean cheering louder than everyone else.<br>
It doesn’t mean shouting instructions.<br>
It doesn’t mean analyzing every play like it’s the EuroLeague.</p>

<p>Often, adding means <strong>knowing when to stay quiet</strong>.</p>

<p>It means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cheering for the team, not just your daughter.</li>
  <li>Applauding a good defensive play, even if it doesn’t show up on the stat sheet.</li>
  <li>Valuing effort, even when the result doesn’t go your way.</li>
  <li>Understanding that today it’s one player, tomorrow it’s another.</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding means helping create an environment where players:</p>

<ul>
  <li>feel safe,</li>
  <li>are allowed to make mistakes,</li>
  <li>and understand that basketball is, above all, a team game.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What it means to “step aside”</h2>

<p>Stepping aside doesn’t mean disappearing or not caring.<br>
It means <strong>not getting in the way</strong>.</p>

<p>It means avoiding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Becoming your daughter’s “manager”.</li>
  <li>Comparing minutes, roles, or spotlight.</li>
  <li>Labeling players as “good” or “bad”.</li>
  <li>Always defending your own while blaming others.</li>
</ul>

<p>It means not bringing home frustrations that aren’t theirs.<br>
Not loading them with unnecessary emotional weight.<br>
Not confusing support with control.</p>

<h2>The myth of the “star player”</h2>

<p>In youth basketball, the “star player” is almost always a trap.<br>
For her.<br>
And for the team.</p>

<p>Because excessive focus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creates pressure,</li>
  <li>feeds individualism,</li>
  <li>and breaks team dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today it might be your daughter.<br>
Tomorrow it will be someone else.<br>
Or no one.</p>

<p>Real success isn’t standing out at 12.<br>
It’s <strong>still enjoying the game at 16, 18, or 25</strong>.</p>

<h2>The team also trains off the court</h2>

<p>There are invisible training sessions that never appear on the schedule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how we win,</li>
  <li>how we lose,</li>
  <li>how we cheer,</li>
  <li>how we respect referees,</li>
  <li>how we talk about opponents.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all of that, adults are constant role models, whether we realize it or not.</p>

<p>What we say —and how we say it— sticks.<br>
What we criticize does too.</p>

<h2>The drive home</h2>

<p>Few moments define our role more clearly than the ride home.</p>

<p>After a bad game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there’s no need for technical analysis,</li>
  <li>no need to replay mistakes,</li>
  <li>no need to explain “what I would have done”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes it’s enough to ask:</p>

<p><em>“Did you have fun?”<br>
“What did you learn today?”</em></p>

<p>Most of the time, that’s all that’s needed.</p>

<h2>Adding so they can grow</h2>

<p>Basketball teaches things that go far beyond the scoreboard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>teamwork,</li>
  <li>accepting roles,</li>
  <li>handling frustration,</li>
  <li>celebrating others’ success,</li>
  <li>getting back up after falling.</li>
</ul>

<p>But it only does so if the environment supports it.</p>

<p>That’s why AP-AP isn’t a written rule.<br>
It’s an attitude.</p>

<p>A constant reminder that <strong>we are not the protagonists</strong>.<br>
That the spotlight isn’t on us.<br>
That our role is to support, not to shine.</p>

<h2>Closing the loop</h2>

<p>As a dad, as a fan, and as a person, I’m increasingly convinced that:</p>

<p><em>The best applause isn’t the loudest,<br>
but the one that comes at the right moment.</em></p>

<p>Add when it’s time.<br>
Step aside when it’s needed.</p>

<p><strong>AP-AP.</strong></p>
