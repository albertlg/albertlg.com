<p><em>It’s hard to make good decisions when everything feels loud.</em><br>
News, notifications, opinions, pressure, numbers, deadlines, expectations.  
The challenge isn’t collecting more information — it’s <strong>not drowning</strong> in it.</p>

<p>Over time I’ve built a small system: a <strong>3-question filter</strong> I use to separate impulses from real decisions.  
It’s simple, repeatable, and works for work, family and everyday life.</p>

<h2>1) What is truly at stake?</h2>

<p>Many decisions look big… until you look closer.</p>

<p>This question helps me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce drama,</li>
  <li>avoid overthinking,</li>
  <li>and match my energy to the real impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>If little is at stake, I don’t treat it like an emergency.  
If a lot is, <em>I act accordingly</em>.</p>

<h2>2) What do I actually control?</h2>

<p>Some noise will always exist: expectations, emails, someone else’s urgency.  
I can’t control that.</p>

<p>But I can control:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the time I give it,</li>
  <li>how I interpret it,</li>
  <li>and the next step.</li>
</ul>

<p>This keeps me active rather than reactive.</p>

<h2>3) What will I want to remember about this decision a year from now?</h2>

<p>This is the one that grounds me.  
Pulling the decision from NOW into the FUTURE quiets the ego and sharpens intention.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What will I wish I had prioritised?</li>
  <li>What will I wish I had avoided?</li>
  <li>What example do I want my daughters to see?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions bring perspective.</p>

<h2>A small system that breathes</h2>

<p>It’s not meant to be perfect.  
It’s simply a kind of internal <em>rhythm</em> that helps when noise and urgency take over.</p>

<p>When I use it, decisions stop feeling like a race.  
They become a process.  
Less impulse, more perspective.</p>

<p>A 3-question filter that, without me planning it, has become one of the things holding my clarity this 2026.</p>
