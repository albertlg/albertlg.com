<p>Some decisions look small but take up a lot of space in your head: saying yes to a project, giving feedback, sending a message, stepping into a conversation with your kids… or choosing not to.</p>

<p>The issue is rarely lack of information. The problem is the <em>noise</em>: urgency, expectations, fear of missing out, notifications, “you should do this”, “have you seen that?”.</p>

<p>At some point I noticed I was repeating the same gesture I make in the car when I want to really hear a song: I turn the volume down a bit. I don’t mute everything, I just let the important part be heard again.</p>

<p>From there, a small system emerged: a <strong>3-question filter</strong> I use to make decisions with a bit more calm and clarity.</p>

<h2>The 3-question filter</h2>

<h3>1) Does this really fit me?</h3>

<p>The first question is not tactical, it’s about identity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does this fit how I want to work?</li>
  <li>Does it respect my limits and values?</li>
  <li>Is it consistent with the kind of person/professional I’m trying to become?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the answer is no, it’s almost always a no by default.</p>

<p>At Mindset Digital this helps me avoid taking on projects just because “we can do them”. And at home, it stops me from turning every little thing into a big lesson.</p>

<h3>2) What will saying yes cost me?</h3>

<p>I don’t just mean money, but the invisible price:</p>

<ul>
  <li>time I won’t have for something else,</li>
  <li>energy I’ll miss when I’m tired,</li>
  <li>the mental mode I’ll need to maintain for weeks or months.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many bad decisions don’t look bad on day one. They become bad when you realise you <strong>can’t sustain them</strong>.</p>

<p>This question forces me to look beyond “this sounds like a good opportunity” and ask: do I really see myself carrying this?</p>

<h3>3) What happens if I wait one day?</h3>

<p>About 80% of what feels urgent stops being urgent if you give it 24 hours.  
The remaining 20% usually gets better with a bit of space.</p>

<p>Waiting one day is not procrastination; it’s lowering the power of the first impulse.</p>

<p>With my daughters I see it clearly: the five-minute speech I was about to give yesterday often makes no sense today. With clients it’s similar: a quick reply may look efficient, but a considered one builds trust.</p>

<h2>Why this filter works</h2>

<p>It’s not exact science or a grand theory. It works because it puts three things back in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>coherence</strong>: your decision looks like you,</li>
  <li><strong>realism</strong>: you see the full cost, not just the upside,</li>
  <li><strong>space</strong>: you don’t decide with the volume at maximum.</li>
</ul>

<p>Deciding with good judgement doesn’t mean getting it right every time.  
It means getting it right a bit more often, and getting it wrong in ways you can live with.</p>

<h2>Fine-tuning</h2>

<p>My goal isn’t to make perfect decisions, but to make them with less noise.</p>

<p>When I turn the volume down a notch and walk through these three questions, decisions stop feeling like an exam and start feeling like a natural movement.</p>

<p>I don’t fix the complexity of the world, but I adjust my own a little.  
And that small difference is usually worth a lot.</p>
