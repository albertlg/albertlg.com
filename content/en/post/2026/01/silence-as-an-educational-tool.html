<p>
There are days when I realise silence teaches more than any brilliant speech.  
And I say that as someone who could easily improvise a full <em>TED Talk</em> on certain topics.
</p>

<p>
But I’ve also noticed this: the more I talk, the less room I leave.  
And the less room I leave, the less the important things happen.
</p>

<h2>Silence as a gesture of respect</h2>

<p>
Staying quiet isn’t disengaging. It’s not hiding what I think either.  
It’s something else:
</p>

<p><strong>It’s accepting that the other person needs time to process without my inner narrator hovering above their shoulder.</strong></p>

<p>
My daughters don’t need a sports commentator analysing every play of their lives.  
Sometimes they simply need… space to breathe.  
And for me to breathe too.
</p>

<h2>The pause that prevents chaos</h2>

<p>
I discovered this on a completely ordinary day, on the way home, right as I was about to drop “that comment” all parents know too well.
</p>

<p>
In my head it sounded reasonable. Practical.  
Even helpful.
</p>

<p>
But something whispered: <em>wait three seconds</em>.
</p>

<p>
In those three seconds, my mind shifted from “let me tell you what you should have done” to  
<strong>“maybe this isn’t about me.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
And yes: that micro-silence avoided a monologue and opened a dialogue.
</p>

<h2>When you don’t interrupt, the important things surface</h2>

<p>
When I leave a pause:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>they finish the thought in their own way, not mine,</li>
  <li>a detail I hadn’t seen appears,</li>
  <li>or simply the tone of the conversation changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Silence doesn’t always bring wisdom…  
but it brings something extremely valuable:
</p>

<p><strong>real information</strong>.</p>

<p>
If I jump in too soon, what I get isn’t honesty —  
it’s defensiveness.
</p>

<h2>Silence also teaches the one who stays quiet</h2>

<p>
Here’s the part none of the parenting books mention:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Silence forces you to examine your own urgency.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I want to give advice out of pure anxiety: I want to solve things now, prevent suffering now, make everything clear now.  
And silence puts me back in my place:
</p>

<p>
“This doesn’t run on your schedule, Albert.”  
</p>

<p>
(Inner voice, not my daughters… although they could absolutely say it).  
</p>

<h2>Small, practical silences</h2>

<p>
I don’t have a flawless method, but I try to use three tiny pauses:
</p>

<h3>1. The “what do you need from me?” pause</h3>

<p>
Before I intervene, I ask:<br>
<em>“Do you want me to listen, give ideas, or just be here with you?”</em>
</p>

<p>80% of the time the answer is: “Just listen, dad.”</p>

<h3>2. The one-minute pause</h3>

<p>
When something upsets me, I don’t talk until the emotional foam settles.  
I’d rather say less with more clarity.
</p>

<h3>3. The closing pause</h3>

<p>
When a conversation ends, I leave a small silence.  
Sometimes an “oh, one more thing…” appears —  
and that ends up being the most important part of the day.
</p>

<h2>Humour as a companion to silence</h2>

<p>
From time to time, when I feel I’m about to become  
<em>“The Man With An Opinion On Absolutely Everything”</em>,  
I simply say:
</p>

<p>
<em>“I’ll shut up before I ruin the conversation.”</em>
</p>

<p>
We laugh, the tension dissolves, and the silence stops being heavy —  
<strong>it breathes</strong>.
</p>

<h2>The closing note</h2>

<p>
Parenting isn’t about explaining more.  
It’s about leaving room for judgment to grow where it needs to: inside them.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the best educational tool I have isn’t a phrase.  
Or a brilliant insight.  
Or an instant solution.
</p>

<p><strong>It’s a small, well-placed silence.</strong></p>

<p>
And like good conversations, good wines and good songs,  
that silence always leaves an echo that stays with you.
</p>
