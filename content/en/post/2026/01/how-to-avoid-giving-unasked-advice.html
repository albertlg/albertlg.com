<p><em>There’s a skill I’m still training every day: learning to stay quiet at the right moment.</em></p>

<p>I don’t mean bottling up what matters — I mean something more ordinary: <strong>not giving advice that no one asked for</strong>.<br>
Not at work, not with friends, and —especially— not at home with my daughters.</p>

<p>In the post <a href="https://albertlg.com/en/dad-ap-ap-add-or-step-aside/" title="Dad: AP-AP (Add or Step Aside)">Dad: AP-AP (Add or Step Aside)</a> I talked about how easy it is to get in the way instead of helping.<br>
This is a kind of follow-up, but brought down to everyday life: WhatsApp, dinners, hallways, the sofa, the kitchen.</p>

<h2>Why we rush to give opinions</h2>

<p>I don’t know many parents who wake up thinking, “Today I’m going to overwhelm my kids with unsolicited advice.”<br>
And yet… it happens.</p>

<p>When I examine my own reactions, I usually find three forces underneath:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fear</strong>: that they suffer, make mistakes, or miss opportunities.</li>
  <li><strong>Ego</strong>: the impulse to show that “I’ve been there” and I know how it works.</li>
  <li><strong>Impatience</strong>: wanting them to learn —but quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The mix is powerful: in seconds my mind is already drafting the full “instruction manual”.<br>
But here’s the uncomfortable truth:<br>
<strong>most of the time they’re not looking for solutions —they just want to be heard</strong>.</p>

<h2>Spotting the “nobody asked you” signal</h2>

<p>I keep a personal red flag in mind (although I don’t always catch it on time):<br>
<em>“Albert, you’re saying this to calm yourself down, not to help them.”</em></p>

<p>When I replay moments where I’ve gone overboard, I usually recognise patterns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It starts with “When I was your age…”</li>
  <li>It includes “What you should do is…”</li>
  <li>It ends with a mini-speech where they barely talked.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing experience isn’t the problem; <strong>timing and tone</strong> are.<br>
If they don’t have space to think, my words become noise —even if I mean well.</p>

<h2>A small system before speaking</h2>

<p>Good intentions weren’t enough for me.<br>
So I built a simple mental checklist that helps me pause:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Did they ask for my opinion?</strong><br>
  If not, there’s no need for the “masterclass”.</li>

  <li><strong>Is this for them or for me?</strong><br>
  If it’s to calm my own fear, the work starts with me.</li>

  <li><strong>Can it wait?</strong><br>
  A few hours can change the whole conversation —or show that no advice was needed at all.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s not perfect, but it works. And when I pause, the dynamic shifts.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to automatic advice</h2>

<p>When I don’t jump into “instruction manual mode”, better things tend to happen:</p>

<h3>1. Asking before offering</h3>

<p>A simple:<br>
<em>“Do you want my opinion, or do you just want me to listen?”</em><br>
changes everything.</p>

<p>Sometimes they just want to vent.<br>
Sometimes they genuinely want ideas.  
But by asking, <strong>I give them control of the conversation</strong>.</p>

<h3>2. Sharing experience without prescribing</h3>

<p>I try to explain what I learned without that hidden “so you should do the same”.<br>
More like: “This is what happened to me; you’ll figure out your own path.”</p>

<h3>3. Making myself available —without pressure</h3>

<p>I often say:<br>
<em>“If at any point you want to look at it together, tell me and we’ll go through it calmly.”</em></p>

<p>This keeps the door open without pushing.<br>
And —curiously— <strong>the less I insist, the more they return to the topic on their own</strong>.</p>

<h3>4. Holding the silence</h3>

<p>Silence can feel uncomfortable.<br>
But most of the time what they need isn’t more information —it’s <strong>time</strong>.</p>

<h2>When I get it wrong (because I will)</h2>

<p>This isn’t an exact science.<br>
I still talk too much in moments that require listening.</p>

<p>The difference now is that I’m learning something I didn’t see much growing up:<br>
<strong>saying sorry naturally</strong>.</p>

<p>A “You’re right, that wasn’t helpful” or “Sorry, I jumped too fast” does more than it seems.</p>

<h2>This isn’t just about parenting</h2>

<p>This lesson applies everywhere:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams that feel infantilised by constant “experts”.</li>
  <li>Friends who jump into fixing-mode instead of listening.</li>
  <li>Social feeds full of confident advice for lives they don’t know.</li>
</ul>

<p>The discipline of <strong>not giving advice no one asked for</strong> creates a world with more conversation and less noise.</p>

<p>I’m still experimenting, still adjusting.<br>
Sometimes I add; sometimes I get in the way.<br>
But more and more, I see that the real art isn’t finding the right words —it’s knowing when <em>no words are needed</em>.</p>

<p><strong>And that’s where care becomes visible.</strong></p>
