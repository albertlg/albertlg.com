<p>First versions are almost never brilliant.</p>

<p>They’re awkward.  
Uneven.  
A little uncomfortable.</p>

<p>And yet, necessary.</p>

<h2>Singing off-key</h2>

<p>Years ago I said something quite absurd:</p>

<p>“Rehearsing is for cowards.”</p>

<p>I said it half joking.  
Half serious.</p>

<p>Now I see it differently.</p>

<p>Rehearsing is courage.</p>

<p>Because it means accepting that at the beginning, it doesn’t sound good.</p>

<p>You’re off-key.  
You fall short.  
Your body doesn’t know yet.</p>

<p>Without that margin of error, there’s no music.</p>

<h2>Writing badly before writing well</h2>

<p>Writing also starts crooked.</p>

<p>The first draft is usually more noise than clarity.</p>

<p>Then you trim.  
Adjust.  
Reorder.</p>

<p>Gradually something more solid appears.</p>

<p>Technology helps me iterate faster.</p>

<p>But even with help, the first version is rarely the final one.</p>

<p>I’m experiencing it with the book I’m working on —“1/3 of the Journey”— and with projects like legoodanfitrion.com.</p>

<p>Version one is never the last version.</p>

<h2>Training without epic music</h2>

<p>The same happens with the body.</p>

<p>Early workouts aren’t inspiring.</p>

<p>No soundtrack.  
No instant transformation.</p>

<p>There’s clumsiness.  
Short breath.  
Consistency.</p>

<p>Improvement comes later.</p>

<p>Not as explosion, but as accumulation.</p>

<h2>Iteration is part of the craft</h2>

<p>Starting badly isn’t a flaw in the process.</p>

<p>It is the process.</p>

<p>Waiting until you feel completely ready is often a refined way of not starting.</p>

<p>I’ve learned to tolerate that imperfect first version.</p>

<p>To see it as a draft, not a verdict.</p>

<p>As a starting point, not a diagnosis.</p>

<h2>The permission to be clumsy</h2>

<p>There’s something freeing about accepting that the beginning won’t be brilliant.</p>

<p>There will be rehearsal.  
Correction.  
Adjustments.</p>

<p>And that doesn’t invalidate the path.</p>

<p>On the contrary.</p>

<p>It legitimizes it.</p>
