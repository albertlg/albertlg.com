<p>I remember that strange feeling in my heels.</p>

<p>A mild ache.  
Tightness in the joints.  
A discomfort that was hard to explain.</p>

<p>You had just had a fever.  
And suddenly, a few centimeters taller.</p>

<p>Growing didn’t feel comfortable.</p>

<h2>The body as metaphor</h2>

<p>As children, no one doubted that it was part of the process.</p>

<p>It hurt, but it wasn’t injury.</p>

<p>It was growth.</p>

<p>Over time, we stopped interpreting discomfort that way.</p>

<p>Now, if something feels uneasy, we assume something is wrong.</p>

<h2>Not all discomfort is a mistake</h2>

<p>Learning something new is uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Taking on more responsibility is uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Deciding differently from how you always decided is uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The problem is that we confuse discomfort with a signal to retreat.</p>

<p>And it isn’t always that.</p>

<h2>Useful discomfort vs. unnecessary strain</h2>

<p>Not all pain is growth.</p>

<p>But not all unease is damage either.</p>

<p>I’ve learned to distinguish them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Useful discomfort</strong> expands you. It demands more, but makes you more capable.</li>
<li><strong>Unnecessary strain</strong> drains you. It repeats the pattern without adding learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first usually brings fear.</p>

<p>The second, exhaustion.</p>

<h2>Growth shifts balance</h2>

<p>Every time you step into something new, your balance shifts.</p>

<p>That creates tension.</p>

<p>Like when the body adapts to a new height.</p>

<p>The system needs to readjust.</p>

<h2>Don’t run too quickly</h2>

<p>I’ve quit things simply because I felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>And I’ve also stayed where there was only strain.</p>

<p>The difference isn’t always obvious.</p>

<p>But there’s a clue:</p>

<p>Useful discomfort, even when hard, leaves a sense of expansion.</p>

<p>It makes you slightly bigger.</p>

<p>Like those extra centimeters after the fever.</p>

<h2>Learning to tolerate growth</h2>

<p>This isn’t about seeking pain.</p>

<p>It’s about not fleeing from it automatically.</p>

<p>Growth doesn’t always feel good.</p>

<p>But it almost always feels alive.</p>
