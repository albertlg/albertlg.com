<p>On March 20, 2026, at 14:45:53 UTC, the spring equinox takes place.</p>

<p>Not poetry.  
Celestial mechanics.</p>

<p>At that precise instant, day and night are almost equal in length.</p>

<p>Perfect balance.</p>

<p>For seconds.</p>

<h2>Balance Is Not Permanent</h2>

<p>We tend to imagine balance as something stable, sustained.</p>

<p>But the equinox reminds us of something uncomfortable: balance is transition.</p>

<p>It’s a crossing point.</p>

<p>From that moment on, daylight gains ground.</p>

<p>No pause.  
No plateau.</p>

<p>Only movement.</p>

<h2>The Shortening of Transitions</h2>

<p>I’ve lived through more than four decades of seasons.</p>

<p>And I feel — not scientifically, but experientially — that spring and autumn are shrinking.</p>

<p>Transitions narrow.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cold feels colder.</li>
<li>Heat feels hotter.</li>
<li>The mild barely lasts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The terrace garden notices.</p>

<p>My skin notices (so does my eczema).</p>

<p>Nature seems more accelerated, more extreme.</p>

<p>Not always sure when to bloom.</p>

<h2>And So Do We</h2>

<p>Perhaps we are not sure when to moderate either.</p>

<p>We polarize.</p>

<p>Cold or heat.  
Black or white.  
With me or against me.</p>

<p>Temperate zones — nuance and conversation — seem to shrink.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if it’s meteorology or culture.  
Maybe both.</p>

<h2>Learning from the Sky</h2>

<p>The equinox is not stability.</p>

<p>It’s adjustment.</p>

<p>It’s accepting that movement is the rule.</p>

<p>That nothing stays the same all year.</p>

<p>That there are phases.</p>

<p>And that real balance is not standing still,  
but knowing which season you’re in.</p>
