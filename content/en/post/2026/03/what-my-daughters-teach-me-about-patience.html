<p>Patience is easy in theory.</p>

<p>It gets harder at home.</p>

<p>Especially when you live with two teenagers.</p>

<h2>The intensity of a stage</h2>

<p>Adolescence isn’t a comfortable phase.</p>

<p>It’s a full reorganization:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hormones running hot.</li>
<li>Identity under construction.</li>
<li>Emotions that change volume in seconds.</li>
<li>A need for autonomy mixed with vulnerability.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the outside it can look like overreaction.  
From the inside it’s real.</p>

<p>Living with that intensity is daily training.</p>

<h2>Not everything is personal</h2>

<p>I’ve learned something that saves me a lot of conflict:</p>

<p>Not everything is about me.</p>

<p>Sometimes a sharp reply isn’t defiance.  
It’s overload.</p>

<p>Sometimes silence isn’t contempt.  
It’s searching.</p>

<p>Separating “stage” from “character” changes the way you look at it.</p>

<h2>The memory exercise</h2>

<p>There are days when patience runs out.</p>

<p>In those moments I try something simple:  
remember.</p>

<p>Not to compare.  
Not to force parallels.</p>

<p>Just to activate empathy.</p>

<p>What was I like at their age?</p>

<p>Insecure.  
Intense.  
Convinced I was right most of the time.</p>

<p>Memory doesn’t justify everything.  
But it softens.</p>

<h2>Patience isn’t permissiveness</h2>

<p>Patience doesn’t mean a lack of boundaries.</p>

<p>It means choosing the right moment.</p>

<p>Not everything should be corrected in the heat of the moment.  
Not everything should be discussed at peak tension.</p>

<p>Patience is emotional strategy.</p>

<h2>What they teach me</h2>

<p>They teach me to wait.</p>

<p>To not respond from the first reaction.</p>

<p>To accept that growing up is uncomfortable.</p>

<p>For them.</p>

<p>And for me too.</p>

<p>Adolescence can’t be managed.</p>

<p>It has to be lived through.</p>

<p>And along the way, patience stops being theory.</p>

<p>It becomes daily practice.</p>
