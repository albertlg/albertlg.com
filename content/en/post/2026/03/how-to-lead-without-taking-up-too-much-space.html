<p>For years I associated leadership with initiative.</p>

<p>With deciding.  
With setting direction.  
With being one step ahead.</p>

<p>Over time I’ve come to understand something less comfortable:</p>

<p>Leading isn’t always about taking up space.</p>

<h2>Space matters</h2>

<p>In any group —family, team, project— space is limited.</p>

<p>Not just physical space.</p>

<p>Mental space.  
Emotional space.  
Space to make mistakes.</p>

<p>When someone occupies all of it, even with good intentions, something shrinks.</p>

<h2>The temptation to intervene</h2>

<p>If you know how to solve something, it’s tempting to do it yourself.</p>

<p>If you see the mistake coming, it’s tempting to prevent it.</p>

<p>If you have experience, it’s tempting to use it as a shortcut.</p>

<p>But every intervention that saves time can also take away learning.</p>

<h2>Leading means giving air</h2>

<p>Sometimes leading means staying quiet.</p>

<p>Letting the idea be imperfect.  
Allowing the rhythm not to be yours.  
Accepting that the result won’t be exactly how you would have done it.</p>

<p>That isn’t disengagement.</p>

<p>It’s trust.</p>

<h2>The leadership you don’t notice</h2>

<p>The most effective leadership is rarely the most visible.</p>

<p>It doesn’t need applause.  
It doesn’t need constant recognition.  
It doesn’t need to be at the centre.</p>

<p>It works because it creates safety.</p>

<p>Because people feel they can try, fail and try again.</p>

<h2>Less protagonism, more impact</h2>

<p>I’ve noticed that when I lower the volume, the team raises theirs.</p>

<p>When I don’t provide every answer, better questions emerge.</p>

<p>When I don’t intervene in every decision, responsibility spreads.</p>

<p>Leading without taking up too much space doesn’t make you less relevant.</p>

<p>It makes you more necessary.</p>
