<p>The more complex the world becomes, the more obvious something very simple feels to me: <strong>being able to explain things well is still a huge advantage</strong>.</p>

<p>Not because it makes you look smarter.  
But because it saves time, reduces friction, and avoids misunderstandings.</p>

<p>And, ironically, in the age of algorithms and language models, explaining well has become a deeply human craft again.</p>

<h2>Explaining is not about impressing</h2>

<p>For years, we’ve confused explaining with showing how much we know.</p>

<p>Long sentences.  
Technical terms.  
Layers of complexity that weren’t always necessary.</p>

<p>But explaining well isn’t about that.</p>

<p>Explaining well means <strong>understanding something so thoroughly that you can make it simple without betraying it</strong>.</p>

<p>And that’s harder than sounding sophisticated.</p>

<h2>A clear text is an interface</h2>

<p>I like to think of texts as interfaces.</p>

<p>A good interface goes unnoticed.  
It doesn’t force you to think about it.  
It lets you move forward without friction.</p>

<p>Writing works the same way.</p>

<p>When a text is well explained, the reader doesn’t stop to decode it.  
They just keep going.</p>

<p>That applies to a blog post, an email, technical documentation, or a conversation.</p>

<h2>Writing for humans doesn’t mean writing “simple”</h2>

<p>Clarity is often confused with oversimplification.</p>

<p>But writing for humans doesn’t mean dumbing things down.  
It means <strong>organising them</strong>.</p>

<p>Choosing what comes first.  
What needs context.  
What can wait.</p>

<p>A clear text isn’t shallow.  
It’s respectful.</p>

<h2>The mistake of writing for the algorithm</h2>

<p>I’ve seen many texts get ruined by trying too hard to please a machine.</p>

<p>Forced repetition.  
Artificial structures.  
Sentences no one would ever say out loud.</p>

<p>The result is usually the same:  
the algorithm doesn’t fully trust it, and the human doesn’t enjoy it.</p>

<p>When you write for people first, systems tend to adapt better than we expect.</p>

<h2>AI doesn’t remove this craft — it makes it more visible</h2>

<p>Language models are getting better and better at writing.  
That doesn’t make the ability to explain irrelevant.</p>

<p>Quite the opposite.</p>

<p>When everyone can generate text, <strong>the difference lies in judgement</strong>:  
what to ask for, what to discard, how to organise, and what to say in your own words.</p>

<p>Clarity can’t be fully automated.</p>

<h2>Explaining well is a form of care</h2>

<p>Explaining well means caring for the other person’s time.  
Their attention.  
Their energy.</p>

<p>It means not forcing them to reread.  
Not making them interpret.  
Not hiding what matters behind noise —and by noise I don’t mean a well-placed anecdote, a small wink, or a timely smile, if it helps understanding or makes the core idea stick.</p>

<p>In fact, quite often it works the other way around.</p>

<p>We’ve all understood something complex in an instant thanks to a seemingly silly example, a domestic comparison, or a tiny story:  
a napkin, an improvised sketch, someone saying “imagine this works like…”</p>

<p>The joke wasn’t the point.  
The mental relief that followed was.</p>

<p>That’s why I still believe writing for humans isn’t a technique.  
It’s a stance.</p>

<p>And in an increasingly noisy world, it remains one of the most valuable ones.</p>
