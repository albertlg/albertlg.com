<p><em>There are moments when you could shine on your own… but you choose not to.</em></p>

<p>That gesture —simple yet surprisingly hard— is what I’ve always understood as the <strong>extra pass</strong>.<br>
A choice that quietly makes the team better, clarifies the play, and gives everything coherence.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about sports. Or not only.<br>
Talking about the extra pass is talking about <strong>how we relate</strong> —at home, at work, and in any project where collaboration matters more than showing off.</p>

<h2>When doing it yourself is no longer the best play</h2>

<p>One of the reasons families and teams get stuck is simple:</p>

<p><strong>We do too much.</strong></p>

<p>We jump in when we don’t need to:<br>
we give opinions nobody asked for,<br>
we take up space that wasn’t ours,<br>
we force decisions that were already on track.</p>

<p>The extra pass is an antidote to that urge to control the outcome.<br>
It’s choosing wisely what <em>not</em> to do.</p>

<p>And accepting that a perfect play needs synchrony, not heroes.</p>

<h2>The instant you choose not to hold the ball</h2>

<p>There’s a fleeting moment when you know you <em>could</em> finish the play yourself.  
You see it clearly. You have the option. It’s yours.</p>

<p>And yet you think:</p>

<p><strong>“She’s in a better position.”</strong><br>
or<br>
<strong>“If I take the shot, we lose what comes next.”</strong></p>

<p>That tiny decision —uncelebrated and unnoticed— builds culture.</p>

<p>It’s quiet leadership: the kind that shapes the system without noise.</p>

<h2>It works at home too (most days)</h2>

<p>With two teenage daughters, I’ve learned that supporting doesn’t always mean intervening.</p>

<p>Sometimes the extra pass is:<br>
<ul>
  <li>biting your tongue even if you “know” how it ends,</li>
  <li>letting them try without your instruction manual,</li>
  <li>giving them space to make mistakes safely,</li>
  <li>letting them have the last word when it doesn’t really matter.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Does it always work? No.  
Sometimes the pass ends up in the stands.<br>
But that’s part of the learning —for them, and for me.</p>

<h2>At work, the extra pass is clarity</h2>

<p>At Mindset Digital, the thing I appreciate the most is exactly this:<br>
nobody tries to solve everything alone.</p>

<p>We share, we contrast ideas, we open blocks when someone sees a better option.  
There’s no hero play —there’s <strong>collective sequence</strong>.</p>

<p>And over time, that shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>less friction,</li>
  <li>more clarity,</li>
  <li>better pace,</li>
  <li>more room to think well.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re not chasing spectacular plays; we’re making sure the project flows.</p>

<h2>The extra pass as a way of living</h2>

<p>With time I’ve seen this pattern everywhere:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In friendships: letting others tell their story before telling yours.</li>
  <li>At the table: listening before offering an opinion.</li>
  <li>In personal projects: pausing before pushing.</li>
  <li>In everyday life: acting without the urge to prove anything.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, the extra pass is a way of being in the world.</p>

<p>It’s not giving up.<br>
It’s not disappearing.<br>
It’s not staying behind.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>contributing without occupying</strong>.</p>

<h2>Fine tuning</h2>

<p>If I had to sum it up in one sentence, it would be this:</p>

<p><strong>“Help without invading.”</strong></p>

<p>It’s a fragile balance, yes.  
But it’s also a muscle you can train.</p>

<p>And the more I practice it —at home, at the agency, with friends— the clearer it becomes: life works better when you don’t try to be the protagonist of every scene.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the smartest thing you can do… is pass.</p>
