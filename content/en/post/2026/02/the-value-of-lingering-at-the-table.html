<p><em>Some ideas don’t appear when you call them.</em><br>
They appear when you stop chasing them.</p>

<p>Most modern systems are built to produce: meetings, calendars, metrics, sprints, deliverables. And yes, they help.</p>

<p>But high-quality thinking —the kind that truly connects dots— tends to happen somewhere else: <strong>when the pace slows down</strong> and <strong>trust goes up</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s where the after-meal moment comes in.</p>

<h2>This isn’t “dead time”</h2>

<p>If you look at it through a productivity lens, it can feel like wasted time. Nothing “happens.”</p>

<p>But a lot happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conversation stops being functional and becomes human.</li>
  <li>Defenses soften (without big speeches).</li>
  <li>Humor shows up —and creativity follows.</li>
  <li>A kind of bond forms that doesn’t fit inside a chat app.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a context where <strong>people allow themselves to think out loud</strong>. And that’s where ideas, decisions, and learning often emerge—outside “formal” environments.</p>

<h2>Why it works</h2>

<p>Without getting too poetic: there are three simple ingredients.</p>

<h3>1) A slower rhythm</h3>
<p>When nobody’s watching the clock, the brain relaxes. And a less tense brain <strong>connects better</strong>.</p>

<h3>2) Safety</h3>
<p>This moment usually happens with people you trust. You don’t need to perform. That frees mental energy to listen and contribute without showing off.</p>

<h3>3) Layers</h3>
<p>After-meal conversations don’t follow a script. They jump topics, circle back, collide. That mix is exactly what allows new connections to appear.</p>

<p><em>Like a good stew: it doesn’t cook in five minutes.</em></p>

<h2>The best ideas rarely arrive in a straight line</h2>

<p>There’s a common fantasy: that good ideas come from a single “brilliant” moment.</p>

<p>In my experience, they come more like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone says something half as a joke,</li>
  <li>someone else bounces it back,</li>
  <li>a third person remembers something they saw/read/lived,</li>
  <li>and suddenly there’s a new clarity in the room.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s <strong>collective thinking</strong>. And you can’t reliably trigger it by saying “okay, brainstorm now.”</p>

<h2>How to protect it (without turning it into a project)</h2>

<p>This space breaks easily: the phone enters, the “I have to…” arrives, or fatigue takes the wheel.</p>

<p>A few simple habits that help (when I remember to use them):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Phones off the table</strong>. Not as a moral rule—just mental hygiene.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t “wrap up” the conversation</strong>. Open loops are part of the magic.</li>
  <li><strong>Add one more chair</strong>. Inviting someone occasionally refreshes the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t fill every silence</strong>. With trust, silence also speaks.</li>
</ul>

<p>And if you want a guaranteed cheat code: <strong>make coffee</strong>. I don’t know why, but coffee is the official “continue” button.</p>

<h2>One of the best human technologies</h2>

<p>We use “technology” to talk about screens and apps. But some of the best technologies existed long before that.</p>

<p>This is one of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it creates community,</li>
  <li>reduces friction,</li>
  <li>builds trust,</li>
  <li>and opens space to think better.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a fast world, protecting this isn’t nostalgia. It’s judgment.</p>

<p><strong>Because sometimes, the best way forward is to stay at the table a little longer.</strong></p>
