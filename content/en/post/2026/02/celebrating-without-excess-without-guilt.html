<p>I like celebrating.  
And I like doing it well.</p>

<p>Not in the sense of making it big, intense, or memorable at all costs.  
But in the sense of doing it in peace.</p>

<p>Without overdoing it.  
And, above all, without having to make up for it afterwards.</p>

<h2>Celebrating isn’t unleashing something you later have to contain</h2>

<p>There’s a way of celebrating that feels like an escape.</p>

<p>As if you had to make the most of the moment because tomorrow it’s back to tightening the screws.  
As if enjoyment were an exception you later have to pay for.</p>

<p>That logic has always made me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Not because I don’t like intensity, but because I don’t like the moral hangover that comes after.</p>

<h2>The problem isn’t excess, it’s guilt</h2>

<p>Over the years I’ve realised that the problem usually isn’t the occasional excess.</p>

<p>The problem is what happens in your head afterwards.</p>

<p>The “I shouldn’t have”.  
“The I went too far”.  
“The tomorrow I’ll behave”.</p>

<p>When enjoyment comes with guilt attached, it stops being enjoyment.  
It turns into a rather exhausting internal negotiation.</p>

<h2>Celebrating as part of life, not as an escape</h2>

<p>The kind of celebrating I care about isn’t the one that breaks the week,  
but the one that fits into it.</p>

<p>A drink that doesn’t need another one right after.  
A long meal without urgency.  
A night that ends when it needs to end.</p>

<p>Not because there’s a rule, but because there’s listening.</p>

<h2>Balance isn’t imposed, it’s learned</h2>

<p>No one teaches you how to celebrate well.</p>

<p>You learn by overdoing it.  
And by not overdoing it.  
And by listening to how you feel afterwards.</p>

<p>Balance rarely comes from prohibition,  
but from experience.</p>

<p>From realising that some pleasures are more enjoyable when you don’t stretch them to the limit.</p>

<h2>Balance isn’t always about slowing down</h2>

<p>That said, I don’t want to fool myself either.</p>

<p>Many times the balance I aspire to isn’t the one I actually practice.</p>

<p>There are celebrations I live more fully,  
not because I don’t know how to slow down,  
but because I choose not to.</p>

<p>And then I compensate.  
I exercise more.  
I drink more water.  
I downshift in the days that follow.</p>

<p>Not as punishment,  
but as adjustment.</p>

<p>Maybe my balance isn’t linear.  
It’s more pendular.</p>

<h2>Enjoying without justifying yourself</h2>

<p>There’s something deeply freeing about enjoying yourself without having to explain it.</p>

<p>Without turning it into a reward.  
Without selling it as an exception.  
Without promising you’ll be better tomorrow.</p>

<p>Celebrating without excess isn’t living at half speed.  
It’s living with continuity.</p>

<h2>A toast that doesn’t need a speech</h2>

<p>Maybe that’s why I increasingly enjoy small celebrations.</p>

<p>The ones that don’t need a reason.  
The ones that don’t drag on out of inertia.  
The ones that don’t leave a sense of debt.</p>

<p>A simple toast.  
Or one that goes on a bit longer than planned.</p>

<p>Shared laughter.  
And the next day, a bit more water, some movement, and no guilt.</p>
