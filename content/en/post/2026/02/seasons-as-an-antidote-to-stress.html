<p>There are moments when everything feels like it’s moving too fast.</p>

<p>Not because something extraordinary is happening,  
but because we expect results too early.</p>

<p>That’s usually where stress shows up.</p>

<h2>We measure life in weeks</h2>

<p>We’ve grown used to thinking in weeks.</p>

<p>What needs to be ready this week.  
What should already be further along.  
What didn’t arrive on time.</p>

<p>This frame speeds everything up.</p>

<p>And not everything is meant to grow that way.</p>

<h2>Nature doesn’t work in sprints</h2>

<p>Seasons are not in a hurry.</p>

<p>They don’t force results.  
They don’t compare themselves to the previous one.  
They don’t try to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>They simply do what’s needed at each moment.</p>

<h2>There are seasons to push and seasons to care</h2>

<p>Not everything is about moving forward.</p>

<p>There are times to plant.  
Others to water.  
Others to wait.</p>

<p>And there are also seasons when the wisest thing is to not touch anything.</p>

<p>When we try to live in constant growth mode, something starts to wear down.</p>

<h2>Stress as a rhythm mismatch</h2>

<p>I increasingly think that stress doesn’t only come from doing too much.</p>

<p>It comes from doing things at the wrong time.</p>

<p>From demanding results in phases that can’t produce them.</p>

<p>From not accepting that some processes need winter.</p>

<h2>Thinking in seasons changes the pressure</h2>

<p>When you think in seasons, the question changes.</p>

<p>It’s no longer “why haven’t I arrived?”.  
It becomes “what’s needed now?”.</p>

<p>And that question weighs less.</p>

<p>It doesn’t push you.  
It guides you.</p>

<h2>A longer rhythm for living better</h2>

<p>It’s not about going slower by default.</p>

<p>It’s about moving at the right time.</p>

<p>Accepting that not everything blooms at once.  
Not every week.  
Not every month.</p>

<p>Seasons don’t eliminate effort.</p>

<p>But they give it meaning back.</p>
