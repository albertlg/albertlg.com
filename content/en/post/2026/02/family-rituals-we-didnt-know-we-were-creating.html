<p>I don’t remember when they started.</p>

<p>Or who went first.  
Or whether anyone suggested them.</p>

<p>I only know that one day you realise  
the same things keep happening.</p>

<h2>We don’t call them rituals</h2>

<p>At home, we’ve never talked about rituals.</p>

<p>We haven’t defined them.  
We haven’t consciously protected them.  
We haven’t given them a name.</p>

<p>They’ve simply appeared.</p>

<h2>Small things, repeated</h2>

<p>The music that almost always plays in the car.</p>

<p>The phrases repeated without thinking.  
The jokes that only make sense at home.</p>

<p>The schedules we end up respecting without noticing.  
Meals that stretch out.  
Silences that no longer feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>None of this seemed important when it started.</p>

<h2>Until one day you notice</h2>

<p>You notice when someone is missing and it shows.</p>

<p>When something changes and leaves a small gap.</p>

<p>Or when one of your daughters does something  
and you think: “this is ours too”.</p>

<p>Not because it’s extraordinary,  
but because it repeats.</p>

<h2>Repetition creates identity</h2>

<p>It’s not intensity that builds family identity.</p>

<p>It’s calm repetition.</p>

<p>What happens many times without noise.  
What doesn’t need a photo.  
What isn’t explained outside.</p>

<p>This is where something shared takes shape.</p>

<h2>You don’t need to push them</h2>

<p>For a while, I thought these things needed more care.</p>

<p>Later I realised that forcing them ruins them.</p>

<p>The rituals that matter rarely come from an educational intention.</p>

<p>They appear when there is time,  
when there is no rush,  
when nothing is being corrected.</p>

<h2>Maybe this is also accompanying</h2>

<p>Not pointing out every moment.</p>

<p>Not turning everything into a message.</p>

<p>Letting some things simply happen  
and repeat.</p>

<p>And trusting that, without noticing,  
we’re already creating something that will stay.</p>
