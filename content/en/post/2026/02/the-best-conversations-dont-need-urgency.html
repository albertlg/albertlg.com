<img class="fotobonita" style="margin: 4px;" src="/img/post/conversaciones-sin-prisa.png" alt="Half-full beer glasses resting on a bar counter, warm light and calm atmosphere" width="720" />

<p>Two or three people leaning on a bar counter.  
Half-full beer glasses.  
No one checking the time. No one in a hurry to leave.</p>

<p>The conversation doesn’t follow a clear thread.  
It jumps. It pauses. It circles back.</p>

<p>At times, there are comfortable silences.  
At times, laughter that wasn’t planned.</p>

<p>No decisions are being made.  
Nothing is being resolved.  
And yet, something important is happening.</p>

<h2>Urgency sneaks into conversations too</h2>

<p>Many conversations carry urgency even when no one has imposed it.</p>

<p>Urgency to reply.  
Urgency to reach a conclusion.  
Urgency to say something smart, useful, or that moves the conversation somewhere.</p>

<p>We listen while thinking about what we’ll say next.  
We interrupt without noticing.  
We steer the topic toward what feels more comfortable.</p>

<p>Not because we’re rude, but because we’re trained to move forward.</p>

<h2>Conversations that don’t want to go anywhere</h2>

<p>The best conversations I remember had no goal.</p>

<p>They didn’t look for solutions.  
They didn’t close agreements.  
They didn’t leave clear takeaways or quotable lines.</p>

<p>They were conversations that simply happened.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s why they worked so well.</p>

<p>Because when no one tries to take them anywhere, the conversation moves on its own.  
It breathes. It allows detours. It changes direction without asking permission.</p>

<h2>The value of not optimising everything</h2>

<p>Some things get damaged the moment you try to extract value from them.</p>

<p>Some conversations are like that.</p>

<p>When you try to make them productive, they lose something.  
When you try to take advantage of them, they tense up.  
When you try to steer them, they shrink.</p>

<p>Not everything that matters needs to be efficient.  
Not everything valuable offers immediate returns.</p>

<h2>What appears when no one is in a hurry</h2>

<p>When no one is in a hurry, other things start to appear.</p>

<p>Small stories that don’t show up in “useful” conversations.  
Doubts you didn’t know you had.  
Confessions without drama.</p>

<p>The conversation fills with nuance.  
With silences that don’t feel awkward.  
With shifts in rhythm.</p>

<p>As if, for a while, time stopped pushing.</p>

<h2>We don’t always protect these spaces</h2>

<p>Maybe that’s why we take such poor care of these conversations.</p>

<p>Because they can’t be scheduled.  
Because they can’t be measured.  
Because they can’t be justified.</p>

<p>They happen when they happen.  
And when they do, they remind us of something uncomfortable:  
that not everything important happens fast.</p>
