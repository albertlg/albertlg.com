<p>I don’t try to prevent my daughters from competing. Quite the opposite. They compete a lot. In sports, in school, in their own personal challenges.</p>

<p>What I try to pass on to them —and don’t always manage to— is something harder: <strong>competing without comparing</strong>.</p>

<h2>Comparison is automatic. Choosing what to do with it is not.</h2>

<p>Comparison shows up on its own. No one needs to teach it. Just looking around is enough.</p>

<p>Someone runs faster. Someone has more talent. Someone makes fewer mistakes. Someone gets more applause.</p>

<p>The problem is not seeing that. The problem is what comes next.</p>

<p>When comparison becomes a measure of worth, anxiety appears.  
When it becomes identity, fear of not being enough shows up.</p>

<p>That’s where competition stops being healthy.</p>

<h2>Competing is not about beating others. It’s about doing better than yesterday.</h2>

<p>This sounds like a cliché, but in practice it’s incredibly hard.</p>

<p>Because real improvement requires accepting two uncomfortable truths:</p>

<ul>
  <li>That today there are people who do it better than you.</li>
  <li>That this does not take anything away from your value.</li>
</ul>

<p>I try to help them see that the reference shouldn’t be a teammate, a rival, or even the result.</p>

<p>The reference is the process itself: how they train, how they listen, how they get back up after failing.</p>

<h2>Learning to look at others without envy</h2>

<p>There’s something I consider essential and rarely addressed: <strong>celebrating what others do well</strong>.</p>

<p>Not as moral posturing. As a growth strategy.</p>

<p>If a teammate defends better, maybe you can learn from her positioning.  
If a rival reads the game better, maybe her timing is worth observing.  
If someone handles pressure better, maybe there’s a clue there.</p>

<p>Looking this way turns comparison into learning.</p>

<p>And it significantly reduces inner noise.</p>

<h2>Excellence without anxiety exists — but it’s fragile</h2>

<p>Wanting to do things well isn’t the problem. Doing it <em>from fear</em> is.</p>

<p>Fear of not standing out.  
Fear of disappointing.  
Fear of falling behind.</p>

<p>The kind of excellence I want for them doesn’t come from fear, but from care:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Caring about training.</li>
  <li>Caring about rest.</li>
  <li>Caring about their mindset.</li>
</ul>

<p>And understanding that there will be bad days, off periods, and moments when others shine more.</p>

<p>None of that invalidates anything.</p>

<h2>Making the most of team strengths</h2>

<p>Another idea I try to slip in —without turning it into a lecture— is this: <strong>you don’t have to do everything yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>In a team, strengths are distributed.</p>

<p>If someone excels at something, it’s not a threat. It’s a collective opportunity.</p>

<p>When you learn to rely on what others do well, you compete better and live with more calm.</p>

<h2>I don’t always get it right (and that’s fine)</h2>

<p>I’m not writing this from any pedestal.</p>

<p>There are days when I compare, get impatient, or project too much myself.</p>

<p>But if there’s one thing I’m sure about, it’s this: I’d rather they learn how to last than how to win fast.</p>

<p>To compete with judgement.  
To improve without breaking.  
To admire without feeling smaller.</p>

<p>If that sticks —even from time to time— I’m more than satisfied.</p>
