<p>
  For the past 3 years of my professional life, I’ve been dedicated
  to positioning <strong>software</strong> in top search engines, as
  <strong>SEO Manager</strong> at <a title="Download free software" href="http://www.softonic.com">Softonic</a>, the
  international software download portal. It’s considered the best
  company to work for in Spain, according to its own employees
  (myself included). And the fact that it earned that distinction
  in 2009 is no coincidence, no. Experiences like the one I’m about
  to share prove it.

  As I was saying, this week I stopped being Softonic’s SEO Manager.
  I’m swapping it for 2 of my passions (2 is better than 1):
  <strong>entrepreneurship and <a href="http://www.uvinum.es" rel="nofollow">wine</a></strong>.
  Yes, I’m changing niches: now I’ll be positioning <a title="Wines" href="http://www.uvinum.es/vinos" rel="nofollow"><strong>wines</strong></a> in search
  engines (meaning Google, Bing, Yahoo, and who knows—maybe Baidu or
  Yandex down the line). It’s in these tough decision-making
  moments that a company like Softonic, and especially the people
  who lead it, show their true colors: they not only encourage me
  to embark on this new venture and wish me luck, but they also let
  me keep working as an SEO for Softonic, drastically reducing my
  working hours. That’s how I’ve managed to maintain my 3
  professional passions: entrepreneurship, <a title="Share your passion for wine" href="http://www.uvinum.es"><strong>Uvinum</strong></a>
  (the new wine-related project I’m joining), and Softonic (a model
  to follow).

  Speaking of the number 3, Uvinum was born precisely from the union
  of 3 individuals, a <strong>team</strong> (and quite an amazing
  one, not because of me) with multidisciplinary professional
  backgrounds, complementary skill sets, and a lot in common. The
  most important factor is our shared <strong>enthusiasm</strong>
  for starting a business on the Internet related to wine, which we
  all love. Who are we? Well, <a title="Nico Bour's blog, CEO of Uvinum" href="http://www.nicobour.com/">Nico Bour</a> (ex-New Media
  Manager at eDreams) proposed the idea on Facebook (yes, Uvinum
  was born through social networks) and is Uvinum’s CEO,
  <a title="Albert Garcia's blog, CTO of Uvinum" href="http://www.obokaman.com/">Albert Garcia</a> (ex-Director of Softonic
  Labs) is our CTO, and as you already know, I’m
  <a title="Albert López's website, CCO of Uvinum" href="http://www.albertlg.com/">Albert López</a> (ex-SEO Manager at
  Softonic), Uvinum’s CCO (and SEO, of course).
