<p><img class="fotobonita" style="margin: 4px; float: right;" title="SEO Link Analysis" src="/img/post/97389-74721.jpg" alt="Logo of the Firefox extension for external link analysis" width="200" height="65" />The information we get about links from tools like Google Webmaster Tools, Yahoo! Site Explorer, and Microsoft’s Webmaster Portal is very static: they show us which pages link to our websites, and then leave all further analysis up to us using other tools. This quickly becomes a real pain when you just want to run a quick analysis for a site, or simply take a look at the text people are using to link to you (“<em>inbound anchor texts</em>”).</p>
<p>Following the line of the previous post, I’d like to recommend a <strong>Firefox extension</strong> to extract more data from your <strong>Google Webmaster Tools</strong> accounts, specifically related to your <strong>external links</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>PageRank</strong> of the page linking to you.</li>
<li>The link text (“<strong><em>anchor text</em></strong>”) used.</li>
<li>And whether the link is marked as <strong>nofollow</strong> or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>The extension is provided by our friend Joost de Valk from his freshly launched site: yoast.com.</p>
<p>Here’s the URL: <a title="Firefox extension for external link analysis" href="http://yoast.com/seo-tools/link-analysis/" target="_blank">http://yoast.com/seo-tools/link-analysis/</a></p>
<p>Don’t hesitate—install it and enjoy. It’s free! ;)</p>
