<p>I’m guessing many of you use <strong>Firefox</strong> as your browser (<a title="Mozilla Firefox in Spanish for Windows" href="http://mozilla-firefox-es-es.softonic.com/">Win</a>/<a title="Mozilla Firefox in Spanish for Mac" href="http://mozilla-firefox.softonic.com/mac">Mac</a>) to surf the Internet. If that’s the case, and you also know the <a title="Greasemonkey extension for Firefox" href="http://greasemonkey.softonic.com/" target="_blank">Greasemonkey plugin</a>, you’re in luck: I’m going to share a couple of <strong>Greasemonkey scripts</strong> that will help you get the most out of your <strong>Google Analytics</strong> accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one lets you <strong>integrate Google Analytics with Google Docs</strong>: logical and expected, right? Here’s the link: <a title="Integrate Google Analytics with Google Docs" href="http://spanishgringo.blogspot.com/2008/06/integrate-google-analytics-with-google.html">http://spanishgringo.blogspot.com/2008/06/integrate-google-analytics-with-google.html</a> (thanks to <a title="Pere Rovira’s web analytics blog" href="http://www.web-analytics.es/blog/" target="_blank">Pere Rovira</a>).<br /></li>
<li>The second one is a bit more complex to explain, but no less powerful. It enables a button that reads "<em>Who sent me unusual traffic?</em>" in 2 Analytics reports: <strong>Referring Sites</strong> and <strong>Keywords</strong> (within the Traffic Sources section). If you click it, in one case you’ll see <em>Referring Sites With 50% Higher Traffic Over the Last 3 Days</em>, <em>Referring Sites With 50% Lower Traffic Over the Last 3 Days</em>, and <em>New Referring Sites Appearing in Last 3 Days</em>; and in the other, <em>Keywords With 20% Higher Traffic Over the Last 7 Days</em> and <em>Keywords With 20% Lower Traffic Over the Last 7 Days</em>. In short, it helps you spot <strong>keyword and referrer trends</strong> for your sites over the last few days... what’s up, what’s down... Here it is: <a title="Trends for referring sites and keywords in Google Analytics" href="http://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/keyword-trends-google-analytics-greasemonkey/">http://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/keyword-trends-google-analytics-greasemonkey/</a> (thanks to <a title="Web Analytics Blog: Occam's Razor" href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/" target="_blank">Avinash Kaushik</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright—don’t hesitate, enjoy them. ;)</p>
