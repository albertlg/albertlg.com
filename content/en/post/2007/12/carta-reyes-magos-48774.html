3 wishes… originality and freshness… mmm… let’s see…
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Dear Three Wise Men from the East (let’s start with <strong>originality</strong>),
</p>
<p>
This year 2007, which is now coming to an end, I’ve tried to be a good boy… and since I’ve never trusted that guy called Santa Claus—who does the same as you, also in one single night and all by himself (he reads all our letters and delivers all our gifts), without us leaving him anything to eat or drink, and dressed in red for commercial reasons (he must be putting something more than Coca-Cola into his body)… well, I’m writing to you instead.
</p>
<p>
I know you have a religious side that I may not fully share (I think the most sincere moments when I ever prayed in my life were when I was watching cartoons on TV and clasped my hands tightly, staring at the window, begging for Mighty Mouse to appear with that “Here I come to save the day!”), but I’m sure you’ll forgive me. ;)
</p>
<p>
To the point: I want to ask you for 3 wishes. But not the typical 3 hippie wishes (<em>Peace, Love &amp; Understanding</em>), no… these will be 3 original and fresh wishes (because I’m worth it… and because I say so).
</p>
<p>
To begin with, let’s go with the second wish (flashforwarding): I want the war between <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistemas_operativos" target="_blank" title="Operating systems">Operating Systems</a> to be won by end users… Micro$oft Windows, Mac OS, the many Linux distributions… in the end it’s not about only one surviving, but about them being fully compatible and offering us practicality and speed for all our needs (it may sound utopian, but it’s not)… solving tasks and managing resources (it’s like asking software to evolve the way hardware does: smaller and faster every time—but hey, it’s worth a try).
</p>
<p>
The third wish is that the “<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost" target="_blank" title="Lost">Lost</a>” never find themselves and keep going for a long time—not just during the coming year… The secrets of the island and the <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iniciativa_DHARMA" target="_blank" title="DHARMA Initiative">DHARMA Initiative</a> should be revealed slowly but surely (and without affecting climate change or the sustainability of our planet, which we already mess up enough in real life).
</p>
<p>
And finally, the first one (flashback): may <a href="http://www.google.es" target="_blank" title="Google">the great G</a> rank us all where we deserve to be in 2008—and may the SEO Force be with us!
</p>
<p>
To wrap things up, the <strong>freshness</strong>… because even though the contest asks for 3 wishes, this letter is “<em>very fresh</em>” and is going to ask for a fourth one: I want the MP4! ;)
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much.
